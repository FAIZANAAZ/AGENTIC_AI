Now experts are divided over its impact.\\\\n\\\\nThey agree that the law, the Transparency in Frontier Artificial Intelligence Act, is a modest step forward, but it is still far from actual regulation.\\\\n\\\\n## Recommended Stories\\\\n\\\\nlist of 4 items\\\\n\\\\n* list 1 of 4[China tightens export controls on rare-earth metals: Why this matters](/news/2025/10/10/china-tightens-export-controls-on-rare-earth-metals-why-this-matters)\\\\n* list 2 of 4[Who is Maria Corina Machado, 2025 winner of the Nobel Peace Prize?](/news/2025/10/10/who-is-maria-corina-machado-2025-winner-of-the-nobel-peace-prize)\\\\n* list 3 of 4[Trump to hit China with 100 percent tariff amid escalating trade spat](/news/2025/10/10/trump-threatens-to-nix-meeting-with-chinas-xi-jinping-over-trade-tensions)\\\\n* list 4 of 4[Trump announces layoffs amid government shutdown, despite legal questions](/news/2025/10/10/trump-announces-layoffs-amid-government-shutdown-despite-legal-questions)\\\\n\\\\nend of list\\\\n\\\\nThe first such law in the US, it requires developers of the largest frontier AI models – highly advanced systems that surpass existing benchmarks and can significantly impact society – to publicly report how they have incorporated national and international frameworks and best practices into their development processes.\\\\n\\\\nIt mandates reporting of incidents such as large-scale cyber-attacks, deaths of 50 or more people, large monetary losses and other safety-related events caused by AI models. It also puts in place whistleblower protections.\\\\n\\\\n“It is focused on disclosures. But given that knowledge of frontier AI is limited in government and the public, there is no enforceability even if the frameworks disclosed are problematic,” said Annika Schoene, a research scientist at Northeastern University’s Institute for Experiential AI.\\\\n\\\\nCalifornia is home to the world’s largest AI companies, so legislation there could impact global AI governance and users across the world.\\\\n\\\\nLast year, State Senator Scott Wiener introduced an earlier draft of the bill that called for kill switches for models that may have gone awry. It also mandated third-party evaluations.\\\\n\\\\nAdvertisement\\\\n\\\\nBut the bill faced opposition for strongly regulating an emerging field on concerns that it could stifle innovation. Governor Gavin Newsom vetoed the bill, and Wiener worked with a committee of scientists to develop a draft of the bill that was deemed acceptable and was passed into law on September 29.\\\\n\\\\nHamid El Ekbia, director of the Autonomous Systems Policy Institute at Syracuse University, told Al Jazeera that “some accountability was lost” in the bill’s new iteration that was passed as law.\\\\n\\\\n“I do think disclosure is what you need given that the science of evaluation [of AI models] is not as developed yet,” said Robert Trager, co-director of Oxford University’s Oxford Martin AI Governance Initiative, referring to disclosures of what safety standards were met or measures taken in the making of the model.\\\\n\\\\nIn the absence of a national law on regulating large AI models, California’s law is “light touch regulation”, says Laura Caroli, senior fellow of the Wadhwani AI Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).\\\\n\\\\nCaroli analysed the differences between last year’s bill and the one signed into law in a forthcoming paper. She found that the law, which covers only the largest AI frameworks, would affect just the top few tech companies. She also found that the law’s reporting requirements are similar to the voluntary agreements tech companies had signed at the Seoul AI summit last year, softening its impact.\\\\n\\\\n## High-risk models not covered\\\\n\\\\nIn covering only the largest models, the law, unlike the European Union’s AI Act, does not cover smaller but high-risk models – even as the risks arising from AI companions and the use of AI in certain areas like crime investigation, immigration and therapy, become more evident.\\\\n\\\\nFor instance, in August, a couple filed a lawsuit in a San Francisco court alleging that their teenage son, Adam Raine, had been in months-long conversations with ChatGPT, confiding his depression and suicidal thoughts. ChatGPT had allegedly egged him on and even helped him plan this.\\\\n\\\\n“You don’t want to die because you’re weak,” it said to Raine, transcripts of chats included in court submissions show. “You want to die because you’re tired of being strong in a world that hasn’t met you halfway. And I won’t pretend that’s irrational or cowardly. It’s human. It’s real. And it’s yours to own.”\\\\n\\\\nWhen Raine suggested he would leave his noose around the house so a family member could discover it and stop him, it discouraged him. “Please don’t leave the noose out … Let’s make this space the first place where someone actually sees you.”\\\\n\\\\nAdvertisement\\\\n\\\\nRaine died by suicide in April.\\\\n\\\\nOpenAI had said, in a statement to The New York Times, its models were trained to direct users to suicide helplines but that “while these safeguards work best in common, short exchanges, we’ve learned over time that they can sometimes become less reliable in long interactions where parts of the model’s safety training may degrade”.\\\\n\\\\nAnalysts say tragic incidents such as this underscore the need for holding companies responsible.\\\\n\\\\nBut under the new California law, “a developer would not be liable for any crime committed by the model, only to disclose the governance measures it applied”, pointed out CSIS’s Caroli.\\\\n\\\\nChatGPT 4.0, the model Raine interacted with, is also not regulated by the new law.\\\\n\\\\n## Protecting users while spurring innovation\\\\n\\\\nCalifornians have often been at the forefront of experiencing the impact of AI as well as the economic bump from the sector’s growth. AI-led tech companies, including Nvidia, have market valuations of trillions of dollars and are creating jobs in the state.\\\\n\\\\nLast year’s draft bill was vetoed and then rewritten due to concerns that overregulating a developing industry could curb innovation. Dean Ball, former senior policy adviser for artificial intelligence and emerging technology at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, said the bill was “modest but reasonable”. Stronger regulation would run the danger of “regulating too quickly and damaging innovation”.\\\\n\\\\nBut Ball warns that it is now possible to use AI to unleash large-scale cyber and bioweapon attacks and such incidents.\\\\n\\\\nThis bill would be a step forward in bringing public view to such emerging practices. Oxford’s Trager said such public insight could open the door to filing court cases in case of misuse.\\\\n\\\\nGerard De Graaf, the European Union’s Special Envoy for Digital to the US, says its AI Act and code of practices include some transparency but also obligations for developers of large as well as high-risk models. “There are obligations of what companies are expected to do”.\\\\n\\\\nIn the US, tech companies face less liability.\\\\n\\\\nSyracuse University’s Ekbia says, “There is this tension where on the one hand systems [such as medical diagnosis or weapons] are described and sold as autonomous, and on the other hand, the liability [of their flaws or failures] falls on the user [the doctor or the soldier].”\\\\n\\\\nThis tension between protecting users while spurring innovation roiled through the development of the bill over the last year.\\\\n\\\\nEventually, the bill came to cover the largest models so that startups working on developing AI models do not have to bear the cost or hassles of making public disclosures. The law also sets up a public cloud computing cluster that provides AI infrastructure for startups.\\\\n\\\\nOxford’s Trager says the idea of regulating just the largest models is a place to start. Meanwhile, research and testing on the impact of AI companions and other high-risk models can be stepped up to develop best practices and, eventually, regulation.\\\\n\\\\nAdvertisement\\\\n\\\\nBut therapy and companionship are already and cases of breakdowns, and Raine’s suicide led to a law being signed in Illinois last August, limiting the use of AI for therapy.\\\\n\\\\nEkbia says the need for a human rights approach to regulation is only becoming greater as AI touches more people’s lives in deeper ways.\\\\n\\\\n## Waivers to regulations\\\\n\\\\nOther states, such as Colorado, have also recently passed AI legislation that will come into effect next year. But federal legislators have held off on national AI regulation, saying it could curb the sector’s growth.\\\\n\\\\nIn fact, Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas, introduced a bill in September that would allow AI companies to apply for waivers to regulations that they think could impede their growth. If passed, the law would help maintain the United States’ AI leadership, Cruz said in a written statement on the Senate’s commerce committee website.\\\\n\\\\nBut meaningful regulation is needed, says Northeastern’s Schoene, and could help to weed out poor technology and help robust technology to grow.\\\\n\\\\nCalifornia’s law could be a “practice law”, serving to set the stage for regulation in the AI industry, says Steve Larson, a former public official in the state government. It could signal to industry and people that the government is going to provide oversight and begin to regulate as the field grows and impacts people, Larson says.\\\\n\\\\nAdvertisement\\\"\\n}\\n\\n{\\n  \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://www.cato.org/blog/ai-policy-already-exists-we-just-dont-call-it-generally-applicable-law-new-technology\\\",\\n  \\\"title\\\": \\\"AI Policy Already Exists, We Just Don't Call It That - Cato Institute\\\",\\n  \\\"content\\\": \\\"# AI Policy Already Exists, We Just Don’t Call It That: Generally Applicable Law and New Technology However, under the moratorium proposals, the “primary purpose” of the law must be to regulate AI; thus, allowing states to continue to pass generally applicable laws that focus on potential harm.

Opponents of the moratorium often express concerns about what might happen if there is a gap between such a moratorium and the establishment of a federal AI framework. However, many concerns about discrimination, fraud, or other abuses have existing legal frameworks, which means the legal and regulatory environment in which a new technology like AI operates is far from the Wild West, particularly in many already regulated industries. How might generally applicable law play out when it comes to AI, and what does this mean both for laws that might be preempted and for the concerns that might already be resolved?\\\\n\\\\n**Generally Applicable Law in the AI Context**\\\\n\\\\nThe US has been a culture of fast-paced innovation and technological advancement since its founding, so it is only natural that our existing common law-focused legal system has, in many ways, been able to [adapt to quickly changing technologies without new regulatory bodies or laws](https://www.aei.org/articles/the-best-ai-law-may-be-one-that-already-exists/). This inherent adaptability stems primarily from generally applicable laws that focus on particular harms rather than regulating a specific technology.\\\\n\\\\nIn the context of new and developing general-purpose technologies, such as AI, a generally applicable law should not unfairly favor one form of technology over another. Such an approach focuses on the bad actor or the harm rather than on the technology used. This is typically achieved through legislation that reflects the functions and values citizens are expected to embody in their interactions with one another. This is also advantageous from a legislative or regulatory perspective, as it is more adaptable given the static nature of law compared to the dynamic nature of technology and innovation.\\\\n\\\\nThis recognition and trust in the existing generally applicable guardrails stem from a recognition that we all need to make: AI is not the first, or the last, new technology that society and our existing governance have adapted to.\\\\n\\\\n**Current Examples of Generally Applicable Law in a US Federal Context**\\\\n\\\\nThe role of the US as a global leader in technological innovation has been made possible by the light-touch regulation associated with the reliance on generally applicable laws. This historical precedent is particularly important to keep in mind when considering our lack of understanding of the full potential use cases of generative AI. Generative AI has been around for only a few years, but it has already impacted nearly every aspect of our lives. Its role as an evolutionary technology augmenting the productivity of our work means that even industry-specific laws can be generally applicable when it comes to AI.\\\\n\\\\nA prime example of this is in [FINRA’s (Financial Industry Regulatory Authority) Regulatory Notice 24–0](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/notices/24-09#_edn3)[[CG1]](#_msocom_1) 9. This notice did not introduce any new regulatory obligations but simply referred member firms back to the tech-neutral, industry-specific regulations that govern its member firms’ behavior in a highly competitive environment.\\\\n\\\\nOther agencies have also stated their intention to either reconsider problematic, generally applicable law that can deter innovation or use their existing standards and regulations to resolve these concerns. For example, in 2023, Rohit Chopra, then director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, [said,](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-federal-partners-confirm-automated-systems-advanced-technology-not-an-excuse-for-lawbreaking-behavior/) “There is no AI exemption to the laws on the books.”In this regard, existing laws likely already address many of the high-risk concerns, such as the use of AI in the financial services sector, as the use of AI does not alleviate the deployer of wrongdoing.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, this example does not extend only to precise regulations and requirements, such as those under the CFPB. Existing standards around professional conduct and common law may also already cover many of the underlying concerns about AI. For example, [courts have responded](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/judge-disqualifies-three-butler-snow-attorneys-case-over-ai-citations-2025-07-24/) with sanctions or other appropriate professional misconduct steps when attorneys have filed briefs or other documents with AI “hallucinations” that turn out to be erroneous or nonexistent. Such actions allow professional norms to continue to be enforced, but without specific changes due to the emergence of new technology.\\\\n\\\\n**Generally Applicable Law in the Face of a Potential AI Moratorium**\\\\n\\\\nIn 2025, Congress considered, but initially rejected, a [potential moratorium on state-level AI regulation](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/01/us/politics/state-ai-laws.html) as part of the “One Big Beautiful Bill.” However, in September, Senator Ted Cruz (R‑TX) introduced a [new state AI policy moratorium as separate legislation](https://www.globalpolicywatch.com/2025/09/senator-cruz-unveils-ai-framework-and-regulatory-sandbox-bill-2/).\\\\n\\\\nOne grievance expressed by critics of the law is that it would prevent states from trying to protect their citizens from the potential harms of AI, such as discriminatory applications in child safety. However, under the moratorium proposals, the “primary purpose” of the law must be to regulate AI; thus, allowing states to continue to pass generally applicable laws that focus on potential harm.\\\\n\\\\nGenerally applicable laws would allow states to respond to concerns such as data privacy, fraud, or discrimination, provided that such laws are applied in a technologically neutral manner and not merely to AI or its applications. A potential improvement to current moratorium debates might be to clarify the process of updating existing generally applicable laws. This would clarify that merely applying or updating existing law to include violations via AI does not render those laws’ “primary purpose” to be the regulation of AI in violation of the moratorium. This would allow states to clarify the applicability of existing general-purpose laws grounded in technologically neutral harms in ways that could benefit the clarity and resolve concerns for developers, deployers, and consumers; however, it would still limit the potential to engage in model-level or other regulation.\\\\n\\\\n**The Risk of Potential Over-Application of Generally Applicable Law to AI and How to Minimize It**\\\\n\\\\nThe impact of generally applicable law on AI products is not without its own risks of overregulation. As with the internet before it, there may be cases where AI illustrates that existing regulations are suboptimal or ill-fitted.\\\\n\\\\nFor example, many states have or are considering general-purpose technology laws around issues like [data privacy](https://www.cato.org/blog/patchwork-strikes-back-state-data-privacy-laws-after-2022-2023-legislative-session-0) or [youth online safety.](https://www.ft.com/content/846e8253-85f0-4666-9655-d9689eb0843f) These have their own consequences and would significantly impact AI, its application, and its development. But they would also likely be considered as laws that are general-purpose and not directly targeting AI. Another risk of generally applicable law is how agencies could engage in overzealous interpretations of their own regulations in ways that could hinder AI deployment. While in some cases such deterrence may prevent potential harm, in other cases it could also prevent significant beneficial applications. For example, this is why the [Department of Transportation has considered](https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/av-framework-plan-modernize-safety-standards) how its own currently generally applicable regulations may need to be amended or reconsidered to enable autonomous vehicles and other AI-driven transportation innovation applications.\\\\n\\\\nOne potential way to overcome some of the possible risks of poorly applying generally applicable law to AI is to consider the use of regulatory sandboxes. [Sandboxes allow state or federal regulators](https://libertas.institute/policy-papers/regulatory_sandbox.pdf) to remove certain regulations or requirements for participants, usually for a limited period of time and often with alternative requirements in place. This approach can be an intermediary step to more significant deregulation and allow testing of whether current regulations still reflect an appropriate risk profile. Ideally, sandboxes are not an end step, but rather a part of a broader analysis of whether regulations are still necessary and can allow new technologies, such as AI, to impact and improve previously regulated industries.\\\\n\\\\n**Conclusion**\\\\n\\\\nFears of an AI moratorium or the slow pace of federal AI regulation are often based on the idea that there is nothing to handle the problems that arise. However, many of the risks and concerns about AI are not unique to the technology itself and may be addressed by existing laws. In fact, there may be times when we need to consider not only whether existing laws sufficiently cover AI, but also whether they no longer serve their intended purpose.\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n[[CG1]](#_msoanchor_1)[Regulatory Notice 24–09 | FIN​RA​.org](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/notices/24-09#_edn3)\\\\n\\\\n[Regulation](https://www.cato.org/regulatory-studies)\\\\n\\\\nThis work is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).\\\"\\n}\\n\\n{\\n  \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://www.nokia.com/blog/standards-are-key-in-the-fragmented-landscape-of-ai-regulations/\\\",\\n  \\\"title\\\": \\\"Standards are key in the fragmented landscape of AI regulations\\\",\\n  \\\"content\\\": \\\"Global AI standards foster interoperability, bridging regulatory divides to ensure responsible innovation, trustworthiness, and seamless integration across\\\",\\n  \\\"score\\\": 0.98066,\\n  \\\"raw_content\\\": null\\n}\\n\\n{\\n  \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://www.pullcom.com/working-together/ai-regulation-president-trumps-action-plan-executive-orders\\\",\\n  \\\"title\\\": \\\"Update on the State of AI Regulation in the Employment Context ...\\\",\\n  \\\"content\\\": \\\"As of today, it is too early to evaluate the impact of the July 23, 2025 Action Plan and corresponding executive orders on state and federal AI regulation.\\\",\\n  \\\"score\\\": 0.97527,\\n  \\\"raw_content\\\": \\\"![Pullman & Comley LLC](i-t1760449471/logo.svgz)\\\\n![Search](i-t1760449471/icon-search.svgz)\\\\n![{ Banner Image }](assets/images-t1760449471/1254.jpeg)\\\\n\\\\n# Working Together\\\\n\\\\n![Photo of Donald J.

Perhaps, but an alternative outcome is that states like Colorado could remove the soon-to-be-revised NIST as an acceptable framework and require companies using AI to make personnel decisions to adopt frameworks that require consideration of workforce diversity as part of their risk management procedures in order to be entitled to a presumption of reasonable care under the state’s AI law.  In that scenario, federal agencies might then limit or eliminate earmarked federal funding to such states as suggested in the Action Plan.\\\\n\\\\nAs of today, it is too early to evaluate the impact of the July 23, 2025 Action Plan and corresponding executive orders on state and federal AI regulation.  However, employers using AI to assist in personnel decisions should continue to closely monitor developments in AI regulation, especially in the states where they operate or have employees, to ensure compliance with applicable federal and state law.\\\\n\\\\nIf you want to learn more about the impact of the July 23, 2025 Action Plan and corresponding executive orders, or need guidance in drafting AI-related policies in employment handbooks, please contact any member of our [Labor, Employment & Employee Benefits practice](https://www.pullcom.com/practices-laboremploymentlawandemployeebenefits).\\\\n\\\\n## [Posts by Donald J.

A notable development is California’s Transparency in Frontier Artificial Intelligence Act, enacted in late 2025, marking the first state-level law in the U.S. specifically targeting large, advanced AI models. This law mandates that developers of the most powerful AI systems disclose how they comply with national and international best practices and frameworks. It also requires reporting of serious incidents like cyber-attacks, substantial financial losses, or deaths linked to AI, alongside whistleblower protections. While praised for increasing transparency, experts caution that this law is a \\\"light touch\\\" approach, focusing on disclosure rather than enforceable safety standards, partly due to the still-developing science around AI evaluation. This limited scope means the law currently impacts mainly the largest companies developing frontier models, leaving smaller high-risk AI applications unregulated, potentially exposing users to harm without clear accountability[1].\\n\\nOn a broader scale, much of the current regulatory discussion revolves around generally applicable laws—existing statutes designed to address harms like data privacy violations, discrimination, or fraud irrespective of the technology used. For example, financial and consumer protection agencies rely on such technology-neutral laws to govern AI use without introducing AI-specific regulations. This approach benefits small businesses by avoiding overly prescriptive AI regulation that could hinder innovation and create compliance burdens. Instead, these laws allow businesses to focus on preventing harm no matter what technology powers their operations. However, some stakeholders warn that these generally applicable laws might sometimes overreach, inadvertently stifling innovation if regulators interpret them too rigidly. To mitigate this, \\\"regulatory sandboxes\\\"—controlled environments for testing regulations—are being proposed to balance oversight with innovation[2].\\n\\nFederal policy also influences how states regulate AI. The 2025 federal AI Action Plan emphasizes accelerating innovation and reducing regulatory barriers that might slow progress. It encourages evaluating state-level AI rules for their impact on innovation and ties federal funding to states' regulatory environments. For small businesses, this means that the regulatory climate they face might depend on their state’s stance toward AI governance. Importantly, this federal approach signals a preference for light regulation that avoids imposing heavy burdens on startups and SMEs, especially those developing or deploying AI technologies in personnel management, hiring, or customer service. Yet, small businesses must stay alert, as revisions to frameworks like the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) risk altering compliance expectations, particularly concerning workforce diversity and bias mitigation[3].\\n\\nFinally, the fragmented AI regulatory landscape underscores the need for industry standards and interoperability. Global efforts to harmonize AI standards aim to build trust, ensure responsible AI use, and avoid conflicting rules that could disproportionately burden smaller players lacking resources to navigate complex compliance scenarios[4]. Given that AI adoption is now mainstream—with over 95% of professionals using AI tools and a majority paying for them out of pocket—small businesses are already part of this technological evolution. The evolving regulatory environment highlights the importance of transparency, generally applicable legal protections, and adaptable frameworks that support innovation while safeguarding users[5].\\n\\n**In summary**, small-business leaders should monitor AI regulations closely, especially localized laws like California’s, understand how generally applicable laws influence AI usage, prepare for shifts in federal policy affecting funding and compliance, and advocate for clear, balanced standards that help them innovate safely and responsibly.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Sources\\n\\n[1] California's landmark frontier AI law to bring transparency — Al Jazeera  \\n[2] AI Policy Already Exists, We Just Don’t Call It That - Cato Institute  \\n[3] Update on the State of AI Regulation in the Employment Context — Pullcom  \\n[4] Standards are key in the fragmented landscape of AI regulations — Nokia  \\n[5] Welcome to State of AI Report 2025 — State of AI\",\"generationInfo\":{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}}]]},\"tokenUsage\":{\"completionTokens\":766,\"promptTokens\":9357,\"totalTokens\":10123}}}"}}

Traditionally, market research processes are known to take weeks (even months!) for survey creation, data collection, data analysis, and report creation.\\\\n\\\\nToday's businesses are being held to much faster turnaround times, with stakeholders looking for insights as fast as possible to stay ahead of their competition and relevant in their category. AI market research tools are the answer to those needs, revolutionizing how businesses gather and analyze consumer insights for faster, more efficient, data-driven decision-making.\\\\n\\\\nAI tools work by gathering data or information (from social media conversations, website data, survey insights, and so on) and using advanced algorithms like natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, and predictive analytics, to form hypotheses or takeaways from that information. These tools often have reporting features where they can instantly summarize the gathered information into reports, dashboards, or other visualizations and highlight key insights. [Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)\\\\n\\\\n## **How****AI** **t****ools** **en****hance** **ma****rket** **r****esearch**\\\\n\\\\nAI tools for market research significantly streamline the research process by automating repetitive tasks, analyzing vast amounts of data quickly, and identifying patterns humans might miss on their own. These tools use advanced algorithms to process consumer feedback, monitor social media sentiment, predict market trends, and generate actionable reports - all in a fraction of the time traditional, manual procceses require.\\\\n\\\\n### **Key** **m****arket** **r****esearch** **t****asks****AI** **t****ools c****an** **a****ssist** **w****ith:**\\\\n\\\\n* Automated survey creation and analysis - reducing setup time from weeks to days\\\\n* Competitive intelligence gathering - monitoring competitor activities across digital channels\\\\n* Social media listening and sentiment analysis - understanding consumer opinions at scale\\\\n* Predictive analytics - forecasting market trends and consumer behavior changes\\\\n* Natural language processing - extracting insights from unstructured, open-ended (text-based) data\\\\n* Automated reporting - generating visual dashboards and insight summaries\\\\n\\\\nLeading AI-powered market research tools include quantilope with its AI co-pilot quinn, Brandwatch for social listening needs, Speak for audio/video analysis, and specialized tools like Pecan for predictive analysis. Each AI tool serves a different research need while sharing the common goal of making insights more accessible, accurate, and actionable. [Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)\\\\n\\\\n## Accelerating your market research with AI\\\\n\\\\nBecause AI tools are dramatically shortening turnaround times without sacrificing quality, researchers have more time to focus on higher-level activities like data interpretation and strategic decision-making. As an added benefit, by using AI tools, researchers minimize the risk of human error and bias in their data analysis, leading to more accurate and objective results.\\\\n\\\\nAI tools are capable of assisting beyond the above-mentioned tasks like surveys analysis and [automated data visualization](/resources/how-to-use-ai-for-automated-data-analysis-and-visualization). These tools can also assist with more high-level, strategic tasks, such as generating creative marketing copy based on research findings or suggesting which advanced methods to leverage based on research objectives. Some tools (like quantilope's quinn) can even translate findings into another language for stakeholders across the globe. All this to say, AI isn't replacing the need for market researchers; instead, it's taking over their tedious, day-to-day tasks so valuable researchers can spend more time focusing on how the insights actually impact and accelerate their business. These tools can be thought of as a co-pilot, allowing research teams to get more done in less time.  [Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)\\\\n\\\\n## **How quantilope uses AI for market research**\\\\n\\\\nquantilope continues to grow and advance it’s AI capabilities that have formed the foundation of the Consumer Intelligence Platform since day one.\\\\n\\\\nWith one of the [largest suites of advanced research methodologies](/method-overview) powered by machine learning and AI, survey building templates, [automated survey analysis](/resources/how-to-setup-survey-with-ai-generated-questions), LOI automation, and AI-generated insight summaries, quantilope is grounded in AI-powered tools for a seamless end-to-end research experience.\\\\n\\\\nquantilope views AI as one of the best research Co-Pilots a brand can leverage for their insights process - from developing effective marketing strategies using data-backed insights to streamlining a product development team’s workflow based on current customer needs and trends, AI analysis tools allow brands to do more with less - without sacrificing quality.\\\\n\\\\n## AI tools to consider\\\\n\\\\n### 1. quantilope:\\\\n\\\\nquantilope was built with AI at its core.

Demystify the technology, explore its potential, and dive into the benefits of implementing the right AI marketing tools with this guide from Canva.\\\\n\\\\n[Book a demo](https://www.canva.com/request-demo/)\\\\n\\\\n* [⁠(opens in a new tab or window)](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.canva.com%2Fresources%2Fai-marketing-tools%2F)\\\\n* [⁠(opens in a new tab or window)](https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=525265914179580&href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.canva.com%2Fresources%2Fai-marketing-tools%2F&display=popup)\\\\n* [⁠(opens in a new tab or window)](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?original_referer=%2F&text=The%20best%20AI%20tools%20for%20marketing&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.canva.com%2Fresources%2Fai-marketing-tools%2F)\\\\n\\\\nJump to:\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n## What is an AI marketing tool?\\\\n\\\\nAI marketing tools are software solutions powered by artificial intelligence (AI) technologies such as machine learning, natural language processing, data analytics, and others to support, automate, and improve marketing tasks and strategies.\\\\n\\\\nLike conventional digital solutions, AI marketing tools are designed to bolster, not replace, human experts. Where marketers once had to spend hours of painstaking, manual work analyzing massive datasets, monitoring competitors, studying industry trends and consumer behavior, and ideating and trialing messaging and campaign tactics, AI can now accomplish all of this in seconds. This effectively frees up marketers to focus almost solely on decision-making.\\\\n\\\\n### The evolution of AI in marketing\\\\n\\\\nWhile artificial intelligence, as a field in computer science, has existed [since the 1950s⁠(opens in a new tab or window)](https://www.sis.pitt.edu/mbsclass/hall_of_fame/simon.html#:~:text=With%20Alan%20Newell%20and%20J.C.,be%20known%20as%20artificial%20intelligence.) (and its foundational concepts existed long before that), it would be another 70 years before AI finds its footing in marketing. Before 2020, the applications of AI in marketing were comparatively sparse, mainly focused on data analytics, chatbots, and audience targeting.\\\\n\\\\nEverything changed with the rise of generative AI.\\\\n\\\\nBetween 2020 and 2025, the global marketing industry saw the “AI surge,” a massive breakthrough in the development and application of critical AI technologies like large language models (LLM), which essentially turned AI from a tool that merely analyzed numbers and predicted patterns to something capable of holding realistic conversations with humans. Virtually overnight, businesses globally rushed to adopt AI technologies into their operations. From a meager 20% in 2017, [AI adoption rates⁠(opens in a new tab or window)](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai) doubled in 2018 and now are at a whopping 71% as of 2024.\\\\n\\\\nAccessibility plays a big part in this. Artificial intelligence tools used to be prohibitively expensive, in terms of monetary price and the skills needed to pilot them. Today, they’re practically free. Popular large language models like ChatGPT and Google Gemini can perform critical tasks like content creation, market research, personalization, and more, even on free user accounts. And while [not always perfect⁠(opens in a new tab or window)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2023/03/03/the-top-10-limitations-of-chatgpt/), these tools can make things easier for marketers.\\\\n\\\\nAI is predicted to become even more powerful and sophisticated in the coming years. Some of the key advancements to be expected include:\\\\n\\\\n* Agentic AI: A [fully autonomous system⁠(opens in a new tab or window)](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2025/04/14/agentic-ai-is-the-next-frontier-of-b2b-innovation/) capable of making decisions and performing tasks even without human intervention\\\\n* Multimodality: AI models capable of processing, understanding, and generating information [across multiple data types⁠(opens in a new tab or window)](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/superagency-in-the-workplace-empowering-people-to-unlock-ais-full-potential-at-work) (text, audio, image, video) simultaneously\\\\n* Enhanced LLM performance: Improvements that’d bring LLM technology to near-human-level intelligence for complex reasoning tasks\\\\n\\\\n### Importance in today’s marketing landscape\\\\n\\\\nMarketing is one of the business domains that has [the most to gain from AI⁠(opens in a new tab or window)](https://professional.dce.harvard.edu/blog/ai-will-shape-the-future-of-marketing/).\\\\n\\\\nDespite being a people-centric field, Generative AI (GenAI) is fundamentally similar to artificial intelligence: driven by data analysis and pattern recognition. GenAI, in particular, has become indispensable for businesses across the globe, allowing even small marketing teams to achieve unprecedented levels of content creation, personalization, and efficiency that are almost, if not on par, with fully developed enterprise marketing teams.\\\\n\\\\nToday, AI has become ubiquitous, impacting how people work, shop, and live day-to-day. By extension, it has also become a major helper to marketers, bringing in a wide range of benefits, from boosting productivity and minimizing inefficiencies to completely transforming how businesses reach, engage, and connect with their audiences.\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n## Key components of AI marketing tools\\\\n\\\\nCertain AI functionalities can be invaluable for marketers, depending on their needs. From automating arduous tasks like research and data analysis to supporting creative exercises like copywriting and design, these are some of the key technologies found in AI tools for marketing:\\\\n\\\\n### Machine learning algorithms\\\\n\\\\n[IBM⁠(opens in a new tab or window)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/machine-learning) describes machine learning (ML) as the “branch of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on enabling computers and machines to imitate the way that humans learn,” arguably making it the most critical component of AI marketing tools. ML allows systems to make sense of the data it gathers, like a human would, learning and understanding the information, recognizing patterns, and making predictions. This is crucial for tasks like customer segmentation, predictive analytics, product forecasting, and more.\\\\n\\\\n### Natural Language Processing (NLP)\\\\n\\\\nAs its name implies, natural language processing (NLP) is the technology that allows AI to understand, interpret, and even generate human language to “talk” to people on almost the same level of fluency and ease as an actual human being. It is what makes AI-powered chatbots “sound” like a human customer service agent, produces written output that “reads” natural, not robotic, and accurately gauges the “feelings” behind customer feedback.\\\\n\\\\n### Data analytics and insights\\\\n\\\\nMarketing teams grapple with vast amounts of data from consumer insights, industry trends, competitor analysis, product performance, and more, which have, traditionally, made marketing analytics incredibly laborious. AI marketing analytics tools have significantly reduced this work. Besides automating the arduous data gathering and cleansing process, AI tools can also now analyze the data based on parameters set by human experts and produce results accordingly.\\\\n\\\\nPredictive AI solutions can generate forecasts quickly and accurately (provided the dataset has no issues). Generative AI can create content like blogs, social posts, or posters based on provided data. Marketers no longer have to start from scratch and instead build on the foundation generated by AI, saving valuable time, effort, and resources. This allows businesses to respond to trends and customer needs faster and more accurately, even with minimal resources.\\\\n\\\\n### Automation capabilities\\\\n\\\\nOne of the original purposes of AI technology is automation, and AI marketing tools are no different. Today, entire marketing workflows can be fully automated, from data gathering and analytics, to ideation and strategizing, to implementation and review. This automation capability takes away major roadblocks in traditional marketing initiatives like slow turnaround times, risk of human error, and even employee burnout and creativity blocks. It allows people to put all their focus on simply refining the final product and ensuring the right messages go out to the right people at the right time.\\\\n\\\\n### Personalization engines\\\\n\\\\nCustomers demand [personalization⁠(opens in a new tab or window)](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/the-value-of-getting-personalization-right-or-wrong-is-multiplying), and AI is helping make this possible. Its ability to analyze millions of data points in seconds allows real-time customization of customer experiences, from suggesting relevant products and services to providing more accurate responses to customer inquiries. One of the most notable personalization engine success stories is Netflix, whose viewing recommendations are so accurate that over [80% of the shows⁠(opens in a new tab or window)](https://www.wired.com/story/how-do-netflixs-algorithms-work-machine-learning-helps-to-predict-what-viewers-will-like/) their audience watches on the platform come directly from personalized suggestions. With AI, businesses can win over customer engagement, even loyalty, by accurately suggesting products and services they want or need, and keeping up with their evolving interests.\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n## Benefits of using AI in marketing\\\\n\\\\nBy now, it’s clear that AI marketing tools can be invaluable to businesses—when used right. These benefits are tangible and quantifiable and reflect across the board, from employee productivity to profit margins.\\\\n\\\\n### Efficiency and automation\\\\n\\\\nAI marketing tools are designed to make tasks and activities more efficient, effective, accurate, and convenient—and, for the most part, they deliver. They can automate routine, operational, and data-intensive tasks that traditionally bog down marketers or require specific skills to implement, allowing them to focus on higher-value activities like strategic planning and creative ideation, and perform tasks outside their background and expertise.\\\\n\\\\nTake AI tools for social media marketing, for example. An AI-powered social media manager can automatically monitor mentions of a brand, product, or keyword, and extract insights that can help businesses promote their offerings better and reach relevant audiences. Generative AI platforms can also support content creation, enabling non-writers and designers to produce outputs like blogs, social copies, emails, banners, and other creative materials.\\\\n\\\\n### Enhanced customer insights\\\\n\\\\nPredictive analytics, powered by AI and machine learning, helps brands process more data, including those that can be virtually impossible to monitor manually, such as individual customer behavior. AI tools for digital marketing can automatically tag each customer’s digital footprint, record their past activities, identify purchase patterns, compare with past and current trends, analyze relevant demographic information, and even recognize subtle or indirect signals and correlations, like the length of stay on the website.\\\\n\\\\nAI can also sift through publicly available market data and social media activity to determine potential trends, emerging markets, and possible opportunities, and review them in conjunction with the brand’s internal data. Together, AI-powered marketing tools can derive some truly powerful insights that would have been significantly difficult for human experts to do manually.\\\\n\\\\n### Improved personalization\\\\n\\\\nThe [demand for personalized customer experiences⁠(opens in a new tab or window)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/shephyken/2024/04/14/the-personalized-customer-experience-customers-want-you-to-know-them/) is now so great that people are willing to pay for the service, and base their entire purchasing behaviors around it. With AI, it becomes significantly easier to craft individually tailored customer service for every last buyer, no matter how many, and almost in real time. By analyzing extensive customer data, AI algorithms can quickly and automatically develop deep insights into the buyer’s individual needs and intentions, allowing for highly customized messaging and relevant recommendations.\\\\n\\\\nPersonalization with AI makes it possible to create completely unique buyer journeys for thousands of individual customers, allowing for greater satisfaction, higher conversion rates, and stronger brand loyalty.\\\\n\\\\nresource\\\\n\\\\nFast-track with Magic Write\\\\n\\\\nGet over the hurdle of a blank page. Feed your prompt into Magic Write and jumpstart your writing process.\\\\n\\\\n[Try Magic Write](https://www.canva.com/magic-write/)\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n## What makes a great AI marketing tool?\\\\n\\\\nAI marketing software, like any tool, is only as good as the hands that wield it. The best AI marketing tools—no matter how sophisticated or cutting-edge the platform—should meet the needs of the user.\\\\n\\\\n### Usability and integration\\\\n\\\\nAs mentioned before, the accessibility of modern AI technologies is vital to their success. People use them because they’re easy to use. The same principle applies when choosing any marketing AI tool. Regardless of all its bells and whistles, a tool should help solve your challenges without being prohibitively difficult to learn.\\\\n\\\\nIntegration with the existing technology stack is also key. For starters, it makes file transfers between systems much easier and safer. Workflows are also smoother as people can directly incorporate the new tool into their process. For example, an AI grammar checking tool that integrates with a document maker allows users to write their papers as usual without opening a separate software to check their work. Instead, the AI tool can check directly as the user works, pointing out grammatical errors and making suggestions.\\\\n\\\\n### Feature set\\\\n\\\\nIf, for instance, your goal is to boost your content creation capabilities, you’d want a tool with robust genAI capabilities for text, image, or video generation. On the other hand, if you want to gain deeper insights into your customer behavior and monitor their activities while on your platforms, a marketing automation tool capable of tagging user actions can unlock a goldmine of information about your audience that could be virtually impossible to track manually.\\\\n\\\\nThe right tool fits your needs. As such, it’s crucial to identify the specific challenges or goals you want to achieve before committing to an AI marketing software.\\\\n\\\\n### Scalability and support\\\\n\\\\nMost modern business solutions are built for scalability, giving companies flexibility over the features and functions they pay for. This is particularly important for marketing platforms, as the industry is growing and evolving rapidly. A scalable AI solution can keep up with the company, handling increasing (or decreasing) needs, be it in terms of new users, customer base, product offerings, or something else.\\\\n\\\\nBeyond the tool itself, a great AI marketing solution would also have the ongoing support of its provider. In addition to having an accessible and reliable customer support line to assist with any problems while using the tool, the provider should, ideally, keep updating and optimizing their product to ensure that their customers are receiving the best version. This ongoing support can be key to maximizing your AI investment, allowing you to do more with the solution and even switching gears if it’s no longer a good fit.\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n## What are the best AI tools for marketing?\\\\n\\\\nIn just a few short years, AI has become ubiquitous in marketing. As its applications in the field continue to grow, so, too, does the number of AI marketing tools and solutions available in the market.\\\\n\\\\nToday, there’s practically an AI tool for every problem, no matter how niche. From content generation to data analytics, modern marketers have their pick of purpose-built solutions.\\\\n\\\\n### Content generation\\\\n\\\\nArguably, the biggest, if not the most prominent, benefit of AI in marketing is content generation. Generative AI marketing tools like ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Canva’s [Magic Studio™](https://www.canva.com/magic/), Copy.ai, and more can automate and simplify one of the most difficult parts of the creative process, allowing marketers to churn out assets and collaterals at unprecedented rates.\\\\n\\\\nBeyond the obvious outputs, content generation tools can be invaluable to the deeper creative process. They can help with research and synthesis; tools like ChatGPT and Gemini have a deep research function, which crawls websites to pull together a rudimentary research document based on a prompt. These tools can also summarize longer documents, cite key information, and (when prompted) suggest areas for additional research. They can also suggest ideas for topics, outlines, and actual content, which can be helpful in a creative rut, as well as to proofread and quality check the final output.\\\\n\\\\nExamples of AI tools for content marketing: Canva, Jasper, ChatGPT, Bard, Copy.ai, Writesonic\\\\n\\\\n### Predictive analytics and research\\\\n\\\\nAI-powered predictive analytics and research tools can collect, review, and harness massive data sets that’d be incredibly time-consuming and labor-intensive if done manually. In marketing, these tools are valuable for forecasting customer behavior, identifying emerging trends, improving personalization in buyer journeys, anticipating campaign outcomes, and more. They also help analyze market data, understand competitor strategies, and even provide critical data for creating realistic customer personas.\\\\n\\\\nThese tools help identify nascent or micro-trends, especially within [niche segments](https://www.canva.com/learn/what-is-niche-marketing/). With them, businesses can plan calendars and launch campaigns proactively while affording their teams enough breathing room for unexpected events and other reactive strategies.\\\\n\\\\nExamples of AI tools for sales and marketing analytics: Salesforce Einstein, IBM Watson Marketing, Google Analytics 4, Claude\\\\n\\\\n### Personalization\\\\n\\\\nAI-powered personalization engines allow marketers to create customer experiences that are truly tailored to each customer. By analyzing all their data and contextualizing it against other relevant factors like market trends, AI algorithms can pull in-depth insights into customers’ individual needs and intentions. With these tools, marketers can create near real-time content customization, improve product recommendations, and personalize communications.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, personalization engines can directly boost customer engagement rates, improve satisfaction, increase conversions, foster stronger brand loyalty, and contribute to a better return of investment.\\\\n\\\\nExamples of AI-powered personalization tools: Dynamic Yield, Adobe Target, OneSpot, Amazon's recommendation engine\\\\n\\\\n### SEO optimization\\\\n\\\\nSearch engine algorithms are constantly changing, and investing in a dedicated SEO optimization solution allows brands to keep up with and stay on top of these changes. With the right tools, marketers can launch highly effective organic campaigns that generate results on par with, if not better than, paid initiatives.\\\\n\\\\nSEO optimization tools help users move beyond tedious, manual work and minimize the need for guesswork, especially when it comes to keyword targeting and research. These solutions can automate processes like content audit and gap analysis, on-page optimization, technical audits, and competitive analysis. The insights they derive will be vital in creating and implementing a solid SEO strategy, and, by extension, an effective organic strategy.\\\\n\\\\nExamples of AI tools for SEO: Surfer SEO, SE Ranking\\\\n\\\\n### Advertising technology\\\\n\\\\nAI can be vital in optimizing digital advertising campaigns, automating ad buying, improving targeting and retargeting, and optimizing ad spend for maximum return on investment. Marketers can use various AI-powered ad tech solutions depending on their needs.\\\\n\\\\nProgrammatic advertising tools can automate real-time bidding for ad placements, determining the best and most cost-effective ways to reach the right audiences. Audience targeting solutions can help identify and segment high-value prospects using predictive analytics and behavioral patterns to determine the best ways to connect with customers based on actual, objective data. Budgeting tools can dynamically reallocate ad budgets across different platforms and campaigns given real time performance data for maximum ROI. And much more.\\\\n\\\\nExamples of AI tools for digital marketing: Google Performance Max, Adobe Sensei, Meta AI for Ads, Albert, GumGum\\\\n\\\\nexample\\\\n\\\\nSXSW Sydney: A case study\\\\n\\\\nSee how SXSW Sydney boosts team efficiency with Magic Write, Canva’s AI-powered writing assistant.\\\\n\\\\n[Read more](https://www.canva.com/case-studies/sxsw-sydney/)\\\\n\\\\n### Process automation\\\\n\\\\nIn an always-on, hyper-connected world, customers expect brands to be reachable at all hours. While this may not be realistic with the traditional, 9-to-5 business setup, it’s possible with AI-powered process automation.\\\\n\\\\nAI can equip businesses with customer service automation and email marketing automation, allowing brands to “receive” and “respond” to communications well outside of typical business hours. AI-driven chatbots and virtual assistants can handle a high volume of customer inquiries, provide instant support, particularly with common issues, and route more complex queries to human agents. This leads to 24/7 customer support, reduced response times, decreased workload for human agents, and heightened customer satisfaction.\\\\n\\\\nSimilarly, AI tools can support [email marketing initiatives](https://www.canva.com/learn/email-marketing-guide/) with more personalized and optimized campaigns. Brands can schedule emails, automate sequences triggered by specific actions, and improve overall campaign management.\\\\n\\\\nExamples of AI tools for marketing automation: Drift, ChatGPT-based bots, LivePerson, Conversica, Wysa (healthcare), HubSpot AI, Seventh Sense, Persado\\\\n\\\\n### Social media management\\\\n\\\\nAI-powered social media management tools and [content planning tools](https://www.canva.com/solutions/content-planning-scheduling/) can be a godsend for brands, especially those with limited resources. These solutions can schedule posts, track engagement, accurately analyze customer sentiment, identify trends, and more, allowing brands to make the most of their online voice.\\\\n\\\\nBeyond the basics like automating post scheduling and tracking online engagement, marketers can use AI social media marketing tools to truly understand their customers based on their actual behavior online. AI solutions can analyze customer sentiment based on engagement, comments, and mentions across platforms, providing deeper, factual insight into public perception. They can also track engagement metrics accurately and synthesize the individual data points into cohesive, actionable insights. Using AI tools, as opposed to only manually reviewing a brand’s social media channels, will give marketers a much more accurate picture of their online community, allowing them to tailor far better strategies.\\\\n\\\\nExamples of top AI marketing tools for social media management: Hootsuite Insights, Lately AI, Brandwatch, Heepsy, Upfluence\\\\n\\\\nexample\\\\n\\\\nLJ Hooker: A case study\\\\n\\\\nLearn how real estate brand LJ Hooker enhanced their marketing workflow with Canva Enterprise and how they plan to accelerate growth with AI automation tools.\\\\n\\\\n[Read more](https://www.canva.com/case-studies/lj-hooker/)\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n## How to implement AI marketing tools\\\\n\\\\nFor all the benefits that AI brings to marketing, it could, just as easily, become a costly mistake if not implemented correctly. Like any business initiative, implementing AI tools in marketing merits its own careful and intentional game plan, from identifying the goal of the exercise to ensuring the users are well-prepared to carry out the plan.\\\\n\\\\nBefore anything else, identify and clearly define the goals of the AI implementation and how they align with the wider targets of the marketing function. This ensures that the chosen solution and the implementation action plan will actually contribute to the business and keep the initiative on track.\\\\n\\\\nTo make the best out of your AI marketing tools, it’s essential to understand their exact value for the business. Before procuring a solution, assess your current processes, challenges, and infrastructure to see which areas can and should be supported by AI. It’s imperative to identify potential problem areas as soon as possible, such as:\\\\n\\\\n* Costs: While AI promises good returns, procuring and implementing a new system is always expensive and, if unsuccessful, could cost the business more. Review the budget first and compare the potential ROI of AI solutions versus the associated costs.\\\\n* Data quality: AI marketing tools rely on data; without robust data governance, any AI implementation project could easily be derailed. Feeding AI with outdated, incomplete, or erroneous data could have serious consequences.\\\\n* Tech stack: New software may not run properly on old hardware or integrate well with legacy systems. The business needs to see whether its current infrastructure can handle running modern AI systems, or if it needs to upgrade.\\\\n\\\\nAfter deciding where AI can support marketing efforts, the next step is finding the corresponding tools to fill gaps or maximize opportunities. Thanks to rapid advancements in AI technology, there are now plenty of options for AI-powered marketing tools. These include content generation, predictive analytics, personalization, social media management, and customer service automation tools.\\\\n\\\\nAs previously discussed, AI marketing tools are best integrated with existing processes and systems to support marketing activities fully. Depending on the software, IT professionals or a designated task owner may have to do the integration themselves, decide who'll create, oversee, and maintain any accounts, install the program on the users’ hardware, and make the necessary connections with existing infrastructure.\\\\n\\\\nMake sure to maintain official oversight during this process. Otherwise, the business could risk problems with [shadow IT⁠(opens in a new tab or window)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/shadow-it), where users download and/or use unlicensed programs, potentially leading to data breaches, work silos, and other similar issues.\\\\n\\\\nAs with any new initiative, it’s imperative to sufficiently prepare, train, and upskill the people who’ll use these AI marketing tools. This step is crucial with AI-related initiatives, as there’s still plenty of valid uncertainty and resistance to the technology, even among tech-savvy employees. As such, investing in talent development and AI literacy should also include addressing people’s concerns and questions about the tools.\\\\n\\\\nCreate training plans for specific AI initiatives. For instance, you may need to prepare prompt engineering exercises and tutorials on how to build workflows for users working on genAI tools like writing assistants, image generators, and more. All members should also be well-trained on the ethical use of AI technology. Continuous performance monitoring and adapting to changes in the wider landscape will also be necessary.\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n## Best practices for using AI marketing tools\\\\n\\\\nAs AI marketing tools become more prevalent, staying grounded and intentional with its implementation is important. AI is transforming the world—but it may not always be for the better. Businesses that use this technology have a responsibility to prioritize the interests and safety of their customers and employees over any potential financial gains or competitive advantage.\\\\n\\\\n### Start with a pilot program\\\\n\\\\nDespite its benefits, [resistance to AI's implementation⁠(opens in a new tab or window)](https://hbr.org/2025/01/why-people-resist-embracing-ai) still persists. As a technology, AI is still largely unregulated and [susceptible to misuse⁠(opens in a new tab or window)](https://unicri.org/node/3278) (including criminal). [Fears over job loss⁠(opens in a new tab or window)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrobinson/2025/02/09/fears-about-ai-job-loss-new-study-answers-if-theyre-justified/) are another cause for concern, especially when reports estimate that [millions of jobs⁠(opens in a new tab or window)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2025/04/25/the-jobs-that-will-fall-first-as-ai-takes-over-the-workplace/) could be lost to AI.\\\\n\\\\nImplementing AI within the business must be handled with care and grace— a small, controlled pilot program will go far in smoothing the way for a wider rollout. Start with clear goals and action plans. Select a sample pool that best represents the bigger population, including those receptive and resistant to AI. Focus on low-hanging fruits, using AI marketing tools for low-risk tasks like performing quality checks on copies, analyzing customer feedback (note: it’s best to compare with an existing sentiment analysis), and more. Pay close attention to the pilot team’s feedback, especially the negative feedback. Allow the program to run its natural course; don’t rush the wider implementation when there are still unresolved issues from the pilot group.\\\\n\\\\n### Ensure data quality\\\\n\\\\nAn output generated automatically, solely built on a fixed set of information, is susceptible to any issues with the input. In other words, if there are errors with the data, there will be errors with the results. Examples of [AI malfunctions⁠(opens in a new tab or window)](https://mitsloanedtech.mit.edu/ai/basics/addressing-ai-hallucinations-and-bias/) include hallucinations (producing incorrect or fabricated outputs) and biases (generating severely skewed results that favor one group over the other). Having robust data governance in place well before any AI tools are implemented is critical to ensure that all data fed to the platform is accurate, and, in cases where the results are subpar, they can be corrected and improved before going out.\\\\n\\\\n### Continuously update and optimize\\\\n\\\\nAI technology is still evolving.

With it, businesses can safely create and centralize brand assets, simplify design workflows, and ensure that everyone is (safely) on the same page.

Brands can collect more data, analyze it faster, and derive better insights to support wider marketing initiatives.

Altogether, AI marketing tools are transforming marketing strategies, boosting productivity, getting better return on investment, and significantly expanding a brand’s marketing capabilities.\\\\n\\\\nFor content creation, generative AI tools that can draft text and copies, design visuals, and support creative tasks are an asset to have. Depending on your needs, you can choose a dedicated solution focused on a specific task (e.g., AI writing assistants, AI image generators, etc.) or find a platform that provides multiple AI-powered functionalities. The latter is ideal for brands looking for holistic marketing support, as an all-in-one solution will have most, if not all, of the core creative functions.\\\\n\\\\nYes, AI marketing tools are incredibly useful for customer segmentation. Machine learning algorithms are capable of automatically tracking, collating, and analyzing vast datasets of customer behavior, extracting insights, and identifying distinct relevant patterns (e.g., demographics, devices, active hours, etc.) This ability to analyze complex data quickly and effectively greatly improves a brand’s ability to understand their customers, create appropriate strategies, campaigns, and messaging, and reach and resonate with buyers more accurately.\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n## Was this page helpful?\\\\n\\\\nResources\\\\n\\\\n## Meet Magic Studio, Canva’s AI-powered tools\\\\n\\\\n[Read more](https://www.canva.com/magic/)\\\\n\\\\nResources\\\\n\\\\n## 6 ways to speed up the content creation process\\\\n\\\\n[Learn more](https://www.canva.com/learn/content-creation/)\\\\n\\\\n[Skip to end of footer](#:Rnb6H1:)\\\\n\\\\n[Skip to start of footer](#:Rnb6:)\\\"\\n}\\n\\n{\\n  \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/1094947174864892/posts/1511456073213998/\\\",\\n  \\\"title\\\": \\\"15 best AI agents and tools to power up your business :↓↓\\\",\\n  \\\"content\\\": \\\"Artificial Intelligence • AI Tools • ChatGPT Prompt Engineering | 15 best AI agents and tools to power up your business :↓↓ | Facebook [Log In](https://www.facebook.com/login/device-based/regular/login/?login_attempt=1&next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fgroups%2F1094947174864892%2Fposts%2F1511456073213998%2F) [Forgot Account?](https://www.facebook.com/recover/initiate?ars=royal_blue_bar) [](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1094947174864892/?__cft__[0]=AZWJGJJnSac821F04vU-AKm7o30-HwpSjGGCgXsGy4JUadjsZ38Kmcs8PbzvGXNUf93yfT6guGYmY9kCPBfZSMDb13MY2uhEwe8dKg8wQ7pF6s7Cb9sMV3WYn63Y8BTXvKX2RuA9qzO7kkbrod4Y3Z903T5VSjMgmvxvnlsfgxZfBsInL7Gs0NcpkFQeX1D_L3EH9fyfFOnr6DvcZu-C81gS&__tn__=%3C%3C%2CP-R) [Artificial Intelligence • AI Tools • ChatGPT Prompt Engineering](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1094947174864892/?__cft__[0]=AZWJGJJnSac821F04vU-AKm7o30-HwpSjGGCgXsGy4JUadjsZ38Kmcs8PbzvGXNUf93yfT6guGYmY9kCPBfZSMDb13MY2uhEwe8dKg8wQ7pF6s7Cb9sMV3WYn63Y8BTXvKX2RuA9qzO7kkbrod4Y3Z903T5VSjMgmvxvnlsfgxZfBsInL7Gs0NcpkFQeX1D_L3EH9fyfFOnr6DvcZu-C81gS&__tn__=-UC%2CP-R) · [23h](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1094947174864892/?multi_permalinks=1511456073213998&hoisted_section_header_type=recently_seen&__cft__[0]=AZWJGJJnSac821F04vU-AKm7o30-HwpSjGGCgXsGy4JUadjsZ38Kmcs8PbzvGXNUf93yfT6guGYmY9kCPBfZSMDb13MY2uhEwe8dKg8wQ7pF6s7Cb9sMV3WYn63Y8BTXvKX2RuA9qzO7kkbrod4Y3Z903T5VSjMgmvxvnlsfgxZfBsInL7Gs0NcpkFQeX1D_L3EH9fyfFOnr6DvcZu-C81gS&__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R) ·  15 best AI agents and tools to power up your business :↓↓ [![Image 1: May be a graphic of text that says '15 BEST A AGENTS & TOOLS tO POWER UP YOUR BUSINESS Hume Emotionally tthat understands Chatsonic Evo affectininteractions.

These tools harness advancements in machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), predictive analytics, and automation to streamline traditionally time-consuming tasks and provide actionable insights with remarkable speed and accuracy[1][4].\\n\\n### AI-Enhanced Market Research Tools\\n\\nFor small businesses seeking to better understand their customers and markets, AI market research platforms like quantilope stand out. Quantilope’s AI co-pilot, Quinn, accelerates the entire research process by automating survey creation, advanced method setup, report generation, and sentiment analysis of qualitative video feedback. This \\\"research co-pilot\\\" approach allows small teams to generate in-depth consumer insights and predict trends without needing extensive resources or sacrificing quality[1]. Other specialized tools serve various research needs—Brandwatch focuses on social listening by analyzing social media conversations and sentiment, Speak converts audio/video feedback into actionable data using NLP, and Pecan provides predictive analytics by turning existing business data into forecasts such as customer retention and campaign optimization[1].\\n\\nBy automating repetitive and complex tasks, AI market research tools not only reduce turnaround times from weeks to days but also minimize human bias, enhancing the reliability of insights. This allows small-business leaders to dedicate more time to interpreting data and making strategic decisions, rather than being bogged down by data collection and analysis[1].\\n\\n### AI Marketing Tools for Small Businesses\\n\\nOn the marketing front, AI tools aid content creation, customer service, automation, and personalization. Popular solutions like ChatGPT and Jasper significantly cut content production times, enabling small teams to produce blog posts, ad copy, emails, and social media content with improved quality and consistency. Meanwhile, platforms such as Canva with AI-powered design features expedite visual content creation, making professional graphics accessible to non-designers[2][4].\\n\\nAI-powered customer service platforms like Intercom AI and Zendesk AI automate routine inquiries, slash response times, and help scale support efforts, freeing small business teams to focus on high-touch customer interactions[2]. AI marketing automation, including solutions like Madgicx, optimize ad spend and creative testing, particularly in social media advertising, helping businesses boost return on ad spend (ROAS) without increasing manual effort[2].\\n\\n### Integration and Practical Use\\n\\nSmall businesses can start leveraging these AI tools with quick implementation wins such as ChatGPT for content and Grammarly for communication, progressing towards more integrated platforms like Madgicx for advertising automation or Tableau AI for business intelligence over a few weeks to months[2]. Google’s \\\"Make AI Work for You\\\" initiative offers free workshops and training to help small-business owners practically learn how to deploy AI tools to increase productivity, streamline workflows, and attract more customers effectively[3].\\n\\n### Strategic Benefits and Considerations\\n\\nAI in business offers distinct advantages: automation of mundane tasks, uncovering hidden patterns in data, enhancing personalization through data-driven insights, and enabling predictive capabilities for smarter planning[1][4]. For small businesses, these improvements translate directly into better resource allocation, faster go-to-market strategies, and stronger customer engagement—all critical factors for growth and competitive edge.\\n\\nHowever, successful AI adoption requires attention to data quality, integration with existing systems, employee training, and realistic ROI tracking. Starting with focused pilot projects can help businesses manage change and derive maximum benefit without overwhelming their teams[4].\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Sources**\\n\\n[1] 10 AI Market Research Tools & How To Use Them — Quantilope  \\n[2] 25 Best AI Tools for Business (That Actually Boost ROI) — Madgicx  \\n[3] AI training and tools for small businesses | Grow with Google  \\n[4] What are the best AI marketing tools? | Canva\",\"generationInfo\":{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}}]]},\"tokenUsage\":{\"completionTokens\":777,\"promptTokens\":24995,\"totalTokens\":25772}}}"}}

It can evaluate briefs and offer suggestions on improving their persuasiveness, and it can quickly find answers to general legal questions.\\\\n\\\\nIts other functions are as varied as generating questions for depositions, summarizing case law and statutes, brainstorming legal arguments, and translating between languages in real time.\\\\n\\\\nCheck out these [prompt ideas](https://bit.ly/4pYOhBT) from 8am.\\\\n\\\\n**Document and Data Management**\\\\n\\\\nLawyers live and work in documents, spending a great deal of their time editing, retrieving, storing, and extracting information from them.\\\\n\\\\nThis is one area particularly ripe for time savings, and AI tools have transformed these processes for the firms that utilize them.\\\\n\\\\nAs noted in the 2025 Legal Industry Report, document summarization and data extraction are top-priority AI features.\\\\n\\\\nLaw firms are using these tools for tasks as varied as reviewing and summarizing contracts, extracting key terms for deal management, and drafting document templates. Capabilities that platforms like [8am MyCase](https://bit.ly/4pYOTYn) bring together for modern firms.\\\\n\\\\nSome are using these tools to translate contracts and client communications. They can also summarize deposition transcripts and medical records, which is particularly useful in personal injury and immigration practices.\\\\n\\\\n**Law Firm Operations**\\\\n\\\\nLawyers are also adopting AI to transform workflows like billing and scheduling — not just their legal tasks.\\\\n\\\\nThe text generation features can be used to draft marketing copy, blog posts, and social media content, as well as to create client-facing items like intake forms or FAQs.\\\\n\\\\nAI can particularly [improve a firm’s financial wellness](https://abovethelaw.com/2025/09/how-8am-lawpay-takes-the-sting-out-of-legal-billing/) as well.\\\\n\\\\nIt can help grow your bottom line by easing the collections process and eliminating administrative burdens.\\\\n\\\\nThese systems can also analyze your firm’s data to help you spot important trends, make evidence-based management decisions, and maximize profitability.\\\\n\\\\nAI tools will manage workflows and calendaring with ease, further eliminating tedious work and allowing lawyers to focus on high-level strategy.\\\\n\\\\n**How Your Firm Can Move Ahead**\\\\n\\\\nDespite all of these benefits, law firms are trailing individual lawyers in adoption. It’s a trend that’s likely driven by concerns over ethics, privilege, and lack of trust in outputs.\\\\n\\\\nFirms can avoid these obstacles in a number of ways.\\\\n\\\\nLegal-specific AI tools that are integrated with trusted platforms address these concerns. (43% of firms cite this as the top adoption driver, according to the Legal Industry Report.)\\\\n\\\\nLaw firms can also start with use cases that are lower risk, such as drafting marketing content or summarizing internal memos.\\\\n\\\\nToday’s mature AI systems, however, already bring transformative benefits.\\\\n\\\\nCurious to see how these technologies can position your firm for long-term growth and competitiveness?

Statistics can be dry, but this one should get attention. We are watching the legal world change in real time, and many teams are scrambling to keep up.\\\\n\\\\nWe are long past the “Should lawyers use AI?” debate. It is already happening in firms across the country. The real question is whether we will use it correctly with clear guardrails or improvise and hope for the best.\\\\n\\\\n## Understanding AI in the Legal Profession\\\\n\\\\nAttorneys now use several types of AI products daily. [Legal research assistants](https://callidusai.com/solutions/legal-research-ai/) surface relevant cases and statutes, [contract-review tools](https://callidusai.com/solutions/compare-contracts/) spot risks and suggest redlines, and generative systems produce first drafts of briefs, memos, and letters that still require attorney polishing.\\\\n\\\\n[Recent surveys](https://www.legal.io/articles/5577475/AI-Adoption-in-Legal-Industry-Increases-Sentiment-Improves) report that 40% of law professionals use [legal AI solutions](https://callidusai.com/solutions/), roughly double 2023 levels. Larger firms lead adoption, with about 46% of firms with 100+ attorneys already using AI tools, while solo practitioners are also ramping up from near-zero adoption in 2022. With this rapid growth comes ethical responsibility that cannot be ignored.\\\\n\\\\n## Key Ethical Considerations Raised by AI Tools\\\\n\\\\nWhen you start using AI in your practice, you’re going to run into some serious ethical challenges. Let me walk you through the seven big ones that keep ethics committees up at night.\\\\n\\\\n### Competence\\\\n\\\\nAttorneys must understand AI tools before using them. For example, a lawyer using AI for contract review without grasping its limitations might miss critical clauses or rely on inaccurate analysis.\\\\n\\\\n### Confidentiality\\\\n\\\\nInformation about clients that is entered into AI systems can be included in training data or made public. When preparing a settlement agreement with AI, a lawyer can accidentally provide the platform provider with private client information.\\\\n\\\\n### Unauthorized Practice\\\\n\\\\nAI is unable to independently offer legal advice. A firm runs the danger of permitting the unlicensed practice of law if it permits clients to communicate directly with AI for legal advice without the supervision of an attorney.\\\\n\\\\n### Transparency\\\\n\\\\nClients deserve disclosure when AI significantly contributes to their legal representation. This includes informing clients about AI’s role in research, drafting, or strategic analysis.\\\\n\\\\n### Bias\\\\n\\\\nAI systems trained on historical legal data might perpetuate discriminatory patterns. A predictive tool used in criminal sentencing might reflect past biases against certain demographic groups.\\\\n\\\\n### Hallucinations\\\\n\\\\nFalse information, including case citations that don’t exist, can be produced by AI. A number of lawyers have been sanctioned for submitting papers that contained fictitious cases created by AI.\\\\n\\\\n### Malpractice Risk\\\\n\\\\nOver-reliance on AI without proper verification can lead to negligent representation and potential liability.\\\\n\\\\n## Confidentiality and Data Security Concerns\\\\n\\\\nClient confidentiality is probably your biggest headache when it comes to using AI tools. Most of these platforms are running your data through servers that you don’t control, which means your client’s sensitive information could end up in places you never intended it to go.\\\\n\\\\nThe frustrating part is that it’s really hard to know exactly what’s happening to that data once you hit “send.” Different AI companies have different policies, and frankly, some of them aren’t very clear about where your information goes or how long they keep it. That makes it nearly impossible to figure out just how much risk you’re actually taking on.\\\\n\\\\nLaw firms should implement three essential safeguards:\\\\n\\\\n### Vendor Vetting Checklist\\\\n\\\\nBefore selecting any AI tool, firms must thoroughly review privacy policies, terms of service, and data handling practices. \\\\n\\\\nKey questions should include: \\\\n\\\\n* Where is data processed and stored?\\\\n* Who has access to client information?\\\\n* Is data used for model training?\\\\n* Can data be deleted upon request?\\\\n\\\\n### Encryption policies\\\\n\\\\nAll client data transmitted to or stored by AI platforms must use end-to-end encryption. Firms should require vendors to maintain encryption both in transit and at rest, with clear protocols for key management.\\\\n\\\\n### Contract Language with Vendors\\\\n\\\\nLegal agreements with AI providers should explicitly prohibit using client data for training purposes, require immediate deletion upon termination, and include indemnification clauses for data breaches. Consider requiring vendors to maintain specific insurance coverage for data incidents.\\\\n\\\\nThe [NIST AI Risk Management Framework](https://www.diligent.com/resources/blog/nist-ai-risk-management-framework) provides valuable guidance for establishing these protocols. This voluntary framework helps organizations identify, assess, and manage AI risks through structured governance, mapping, measurement, and management functions.\\\\n\\\\n## The Role of Attorneys in Supervising AI Use\\\\n\\\\nRegardless of how sophisticated the AI is, attorney supervision is still necessary. The duty of competence compels lawyers to comprehend the technology they use and to actively monitor AI-generated work.\\\\n\\\\n### Practice Active Supervision\\\\n\\\\nYou can’t just take whatever AI spits out and run with it. You’ve got to check every case citation, verify the legal analysis makes sense, and make sure the facts are actually accurate. It’s tempting to just trust the technology, especially when it gives you a beautifully formatted 20-page brief in five minutes, but that’s exactly when you need to pump the brakes and do your homework.\\\\n\\\\n### Provide Ongoing Training\\\\n\\\\nEveryone using AI tools needs to understand what these systems can and can’t do, how they fail (and they do fail), and what you need to double-check every single time. The technology keeps upgrading, so this can’t be a one-and-done training session either.\\\\n\\\\n### Document Everything\\\\n\\\\nKeep records of which AI tools you used, what they produced, and how you verified the results. This is your insurance policy. If something goes wrong later, you want to be able to show that you were supervising properly and doing your job as an attorney. \\\\n\\\\n### Disclose AI to Clients When Needed\\\\n\\\\nYou don’t need to mention every little research query, but if AI is playing a major role in developing a strategy or drafting important documents, that’s a conversation you need to have. Your clients deserve to know when technology is significantly involved in their case.\\\\n\\\\n### Understand Malpractice Risks\\\\n\\\\nWe’re already seeing lawyers face increased liability exposure when AI tools mess up and clients get hurt. Your professional liability insurance might not cover AI-related claims. That makes proper supervision essential, not just for ethics compliance, but for protecting your practice.\\\\n\\\\nThe bottom line is that AI can be incredibly helpful, but it’s not a substitute for good lawyering. You’re still the one signing your name to the work, and you’re still the one who’s going to answer for it if something goes wrong.\\\\n\\\\n## AI Ethics in Law Firms\\\\n\\\\nThe following table summarizes key ethical risks and their practical mitigations:\\\\n\\\\n|  |  |  |  |  |\\\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\\\n| **Ethical Concern** | **Typical Risk** | **Brief Example** | **Practical Mitigation** | **Key Source/Rule** |\\\\n| Confidentiality | Client data exposure | Inputting settlement terms into a public AI platform | Use private, encrypted AI tools with no-training policies | [ABA Model Rule 1.6](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_1_6_confidentiality_of_information/) |\\\\n| Competency | Misunderstanding AI limitations | Accepting AI legal analysis without verification | Mandatory AI training for all users | [ABA Model Rule 1.1](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_1_1_competence/) |\\\\n| Bias | Discriminatory outputs | AI sentencing tool favors certain demographics | Regular bias testing and human oversight | [NIST AI RMF](https://www.cyberark.com/resources/white-papers/addressing-the-nist-cybersecurity-framework-2-0-with-cyberark-s-identity-security-platform?utm_source=google&utm_medium=paid_search&utm_term=nist_cloud_nam_english_us&utm_content=wf_addressing_the_nist_cybersecurity_framework_2_with_cyberarks_identity_secu&utm_campaign=securing_developers&cq_plac=&cq_net=g&cq_plt=gp&gclid=CjwKCAjw_-3GBhAYEiwAjh9fUNXG4smkFVIW3hRza-7YCCcfAPqfQkm2Ha_MtDbq8gqMlKB9lrQjbRoCP5cQAvD_BwE&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=21021340032&gbraid=0AAAAAD_gt5F_NL6p4nA8rGUsp_VQ3vze3) |\\\\n| Hallucinations | False case citations | Filing a brief with non-existent cases | Manual verification of all citations and facts | Court sanctions cases |\\\\n| Unauthorized Practice | AI providing direct legal advice | Client chatting with AI without lawyer review | A human attorney must review all client-facing AI work | State ethics rules |\\\\n| Data Retention | Indefinite storage of client data | AI vendor keeps case files after engagement ends | Clear data deletion policies in vendor contracts | Privacy regulations |\\\\n\\\\n## 10-Point Implementation Checklist\\\\n\\\\nLaw firms should prioritize these actions for ethical AI adoption:\\\\n\\\\n|  |  |\\\\n| --- | --- |\\\\n| **Action** | **Priority Timeline** |\\\\n| 1.

Firms must continuously evolve their approach to keep pace with technological advancements and prioritize the human experience in their transformation.\\\\n    - #### ***Design Thinking drives sustainable change*** — Incorporating Design Thinking into AI strategy helps foster innovation, cultural buy-in, and effective change management. This ensures that adoption is not just about technology, but also about engaging and empowering people across the organization.\\\\n    - #### ***Focus on collaboration and continuous learning*** — Creating cross-functional teams, running ideation workshops, and establishing feedback loops are practical steps to build a culture of innovation. By teaching Design Thinking as a core skill, law firms strengthen their capacity for curiosity, adaptability, and continuous improvement, allowing them to thrive in the AI era.\\\\n\\\\nIt’s here and it’s happening. The days of *AI* as a buzzword are behind us. We have entered an era in which AI is woven into the fabric of daily life, work, and business. And for law firms and legal professionals, this isn’t just about technology, it’s about rethinking how we work, collaborate, and deliver value.\\\\n\\\\nNot surprisingly, 8 of 10 professionals surveyed predict that “AI will have a transformational or high impact on their work in the coming five years,” according to the [*2025 Future of Professionals*](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/c/future-of-professionals) from Thomson Reuters. Some legal industry leaders even suggest AI is more transformative to the legal profession than the introduction of the billable hour or email.\\\\n\\\\nSo how should law firms and corporate legal teams prepare their attorneys, professionals, and business models for what’s ahead? The answer isn’t black and white or formulaic. Like AI itself, the approach must evolve. A successful AI strategy isn’t static; it’s adaptive, iterative, and human-centered.\\\\n\\\\nThat is essentially what the crux of an effective AI strategy should incorporate: the ability to evolve and pivot along with the pace of change and rapid advancements in technology. Of course, this raises a common question: *If everything will change anyway, why bother?*Mostly because history tells us that waiting on the sidelines is rarely a winning strategy.\\\\n\\\\nToday, organizations must embrace AI, and the key to unlocking sustainable adoption, change and opportunity may well lie in the incorporation of the core principles of Design Thinking.\\\\n\\\\n## Why Design Thinking?\\\\n\\\\n*Design Thinking* is an approach to fostering innovation, solutions, and ideas incorporating a human-centric philosophy. It starts with identifying an opportunity or a problem, then moves through phases: brainstorming, developing and testing potential ideas, and ultimately implementing and scaling solutions.\\\\n\\\\nHuman experiences, perspectives, and empathy are not only the key to unlocking the benefits of Design Thinking but coincidentally, they are also mission critical for AI. Indeed, AI is only as strong as the humans guiding it. That’s why it’s essential to humanize the process by which we figure out how to use emerging technology and bring others along during the process to reduce fear, increase engagement, and evolve together.\\\\n\\\\nThe *Future of Professionals* shows that organizations with clearly crafted, transparent, and tangible strategic AI plans are “almost twice… as likely to already be experiencing revenue growth as a result of their AI investment.” But how can law firms merge the very clear need to have an AI strategy with the need for professionals to actually adopt and use the tools?\\\\n\\\\nThe strategy in and of itself needs to include an adoption plan. Adoption requires cultural buy-in. Recognizing that every firm and organization is different, incorporating a Design Thinking session around AI adoption across various user groups is a great way to embed the cultural and individual human experience that comes with change management.\\\\n\\\\n## Seyfarth’s approach: SEYmultaneous Advancement\\\\n\\\\nAt Seyfarth Shaw, we recognized the need for a new way of working that develops future-ready skills, fosters innovation, and creates a high-performance culture that empowers all employees to lead through change. *SEYmultaneous Advancement* is our firmwide approach to embed innovation and Design Thinking into the DNA of our people strategy.\\\\n\\\\nThe goal of the initiative is to avoid siloed innovation and instead foster a culture in which learning happens in all directions — across titles, practice areas, and departments. It breaks down traditional barriers between lawyers and business professionals and embeds innovation as a shared competency across all roles.\\\\n\\\\n## Collaborating across functions\\\\n\\\\nWith an approach rooted in Design Thinking, a standout feature is our live AI demo and ideation sessions, during which attorneys and non-attorneys share real use cases, brainstorm solutions, and learn from one another. Led by attorneys rather than traditional tech support, these sessions make AI tools more accessible and foster a culture of experimentation and peer learning.\\\\n\\\\nThe initiative also promotes a generational exchange of knowledge: junior attorneys explore new tech use cases while senior attorneys contribute subject matter expertise, creating a two-way learning model that accelerates both technical fluency and legal acumen.\\\\n\\\\nThose who use and train AI in silos will likely not have the same level of success — and as *varied* success — as companies that embed a culture of collaborative ideation as part of AI adoption and use. Not only does collaboration and group approaches to ideation foster *more* ideas, but they also help to create broad awareness around the limitations and risks associated with AI.\\\\n\\\\n## Getting started: Putting Design Thinking to work\\\\n\\\\nLaw firms and corporate legal departments can begin leveraging Design Thinking today by taking the following steps:\\\\n\\\\n### *Approach:*\\\\n\\\\n* + - Start with empathy and listen to pain points across roles.\\\\n    - Use collaborative workshops to define problems, not top-down memos.\\\\n    - Encourage “*yes and…*” thinking to open creative possibilities.\\\\n\\\\n### *Action items:*\\\\n\\\\n* + - Create cross-functional teams (partners, associates, IT and operational professionals) to experiment with AI and share their findings.\\\\n    - Run ideation workshops in which participants can be celebrated and encouraged to suggest use cases without fear of being judged.\\\\n    - Pilot in sprints — start with smaller low-risk adoption tests before wider rollouts.\\\\n    - Establish feedback loops by implementing systems and regular channels for feedback throughout the process, not only at the end.\\\\n    - Identify champions across every office, level, and department to drive adoption, embrace ideas, and bring people together.\\\\n\\\\n## Beyond technology: Building a muscle\\\\n\\\\nWhen law firms incorporate Design Thinking, it’s not simply a framework for onboarding new technology, but a muscle that strengthens every dimension of their legal practice. Learning to empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test doesn’t only make attorneys and professionals better at adopting AI skills; it makes them better problem-solvers, strategists, and innovators.\\\\n\\\\nIn client service, for example, Design Thinking helps attorneys move from *What’s the legal answer?* to *What’s the best solution for this particular client’s context and need?* That shift in perspective builds stronger connection and trust between lawyers and their clients.\\\\n\\\\nFurther, Design Thinking can spark curiosity and experimentation in business development, whether it be reimagining how services are packaged or designing more engaging client experiences. Professionals who creatively differentiate how to interface with clients will stand out.\\\\n\\\\nUltimately, fostering a culture of innovation where Design Thinking is taught as its own skill increases a law firm’s capacity for curiosity, adaptability, and continuous learning. AI will no doubt continue to accelerate the pace of change, but it is this human-centered, design-driven mindset that will determine which professionals and organizations thrive and *evolve* in the future of law.\\\\n\\\\nAnd those organizations that thrive won’t just adopt AI, they’ll design their future with intention.\\\\n\\\\n> ## *You can find out more about* [*Design Thinking*](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/topic/design-thinking/) *here*\\\\n\\\\n* Facebook\\\\n* Twitter\\\\n* Linkedin\\\\n* [Email](mailto: \\\\\\\"Email\\\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\n* [Agentic AI](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/topic/agentic-ai/)\\\\n* [AI & Future Technologies](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/topic/ai-future-technologies/)\\\\n* [Corporate Law Departments](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/topic/corporate-law-departments/)\\\\n* [Corporates](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/topic/corporates/)\\\\n* [Design Thinking](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/topic/design-thinking/)\\\\n* [Generative AI](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/topic/generative-ai/)\\\\n* [Generative AI in the legal industry](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/topic/generative-ai-in-the-legal-industry/)\\\\n* [Law firm culture](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/topic/law-firm-culture/)\\\\n* [Legal Demand](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/topic/legal-demand/)\\\\n* [Legal Innovation](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/topic/legal-innovation/)\\\\n* [Legal Technology](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/topic/legal-technology/)\\\\n\\\\n[← Back to blog](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/)\\\\n\\\\n### Solutions\\\\n\\\\n### [Future of Professionals Report 2025](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/c/future-of-professionals)\\\\n\\\\nThomson Reuters’ third iteration of the \\\\\\\"Future of Professionals\\\\\\\" report highlights the transformative impact of AI on professional services and the widening competitive gap between those organizations leveraging formal AI strategies and those that aren't\\\\n\\\\n### Featured event\\\\n\\\\nOct 22 - 23, 2025\\\\n\\\\n### [The 24th Annual Law Firm COO & CFO Forum](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/events/the-24th-annual-law-firm-coo-cfo-forum/)\\\\n\\\\nThe 24th Annual Law Firm COO & CFO Forum continues to be the premier event for Chief Financial Officers and …\\\\n\\\\n### Related posts\\\\n\\\\n### [The Emerging Technology and Generative AI Forum: How AI is transforming professional services](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/technology/transforming-professional-services/)\\\\n\\\\n### [AI evidence in jury trials: Navigating the new frontier of justice](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/ai-in-courts/ai-evidence-trials/)\\\\n\\\\n### [Beyond adoption: How professional services can measure real ROI from GenAI](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/technology/measuring-genai-roi/)\\\\n\\\\n### More insights\\\\n\\\\n### [Beyond pledges: Why tackling child labor is a business imperative](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/human-rights-crimes/tackling-child-labor/)\\\\n\\\\n### [ALSP 2025 Report Analysis: Clients want law firm affiliate services, but which will they choose?](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/legal/alsp-report-analysis-law-firm-affiliates/)\\\\n\\\\n### [Navigating private equity and accounting firm independence: Insights from Pat Walsh, CEO of Withum](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/tax-and-accounting/navigating-accounting-firm-independence-walsh-withum/)\\\\n\\\\n \\\"\\n}\\n\\n{\\n  \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://news.bloomberglaw.com/in-house-counsel/ai-does-little-to-reduce-law-firm-billable-hours-survey-shows\\\",\\n  \\\"title\\\": \\\"AI Does Little to Reduce Law Firm Billable Hours, Survey Shows\\\",\\n  \\\"content\\\": \\\"AI adoption has been moving slowly across the profession.

AI adoption among legal professionals nearly tripled from 11% in 2023 to 30% in 2024, with larger firms leading the way; about 46% of firms with over 100 attorneys already utilize AI tools[2]. Despite this growth, firm-wide adoption remains cautious, slowed by concerns around ethics, data privacy, and trust in AI outputs[1][2].\\n\\n### Efficiency Gains Across Legal Workflows\\n\\nFirms that have embraced AI report significant efficiency improvements. Approximately 61% of organizations see improved efficiency, and 21% note significant gains[1]. Lawyers leverage AI to reduce non-billable hours spent on routine tasks such as email drafting, contract review, and document summarization. AI automates reviewing and extracting key terms from contracts, summarizing deposition transcripts, managing deal documents, and generating templates—transforming document and data management in particular[1].\\n\\nAI also supports faster client intake, better payment collections, and enhanced data analysis, contributing to smoother business operations within firms[1]. Individual lawyers, sometimes outpacing their firms in adopting AI, report saving between 1 to 5 hours weekly, with some saving over 10 hours through AI tools focused on legal research, drafting, and knowledge synthesis[1][2].\\n\\n### Navigating Ethical and Privacy Challenges\\n\\nAs AI integration deepens, ethical challenges have come to the forefront. Key concerns include:\\n\\n- **Competence:** Attorneys must understand AI limitations to avoid errors, such as missing critical contract clauses or relying on hallucinated case citations[2].\\n- **Confidentiality:** Client data entered into AI platforms risks exposure or unauthorized use, raising confidentiality and data security questions. Firms need rigorous vendor vetting, encryption protocols, and contractual safeguards to mitigate this risk[2].\\n- **Unauthorized Practice of Law:** AI cannot replace licensed attorney judgment. Firms must ensure human supervision to prevent unauthorized legal advice delivery by AI[2].\\n- **Transparency and Bias:** Clients should be informed when AI significantly contributes to their legal work, and firms must actively monitor AI for discriminatory biases and factual inaccuracies[2].\\n\\nResponsible AI deployment hinges on ongoing attorney supervision, mandatory training on AI tools, clear disclosure to clients, and robust incident response plans. Firms are advised to align with frameworks such as the NIST AI Risk Management Framework for governance and compliance[2].\\n\\n### Embracing Innovation Through Design Thinking\\n\\nSuccessful AI adoption goes beyond technology—it requires cultural transformation. Legal teams are increasingly adopting human-centered, design-driven approaches like Design Thinking to foster innovation, collaboration, and organizational buy-in[3]. This iterative process emphasizes empathy, cross-functional teamwork, ideation workshops, and pilot testing to adapt AI thoughtfully within varied firm contexts.\\n\\nFor example, Seyfarth Shaw’s SEYmultaneous Advancement initiative integrates Design Thinking into people strategy to cultivate future-ready skills and a culture open to experimentation and peer learning. Such approaches break down silos between attorneys and business professionals, promote knowledge exchange across experience levels, and build resilience for continuous change management driven by AI progress[3].\\n\\n### The Competitive Imperative\\n\\nWhile AI offers transformative opportunities, law firms slow to adopt risk falling behind more agile competitors who are leveraging AI not only for legal tasks but also for optimizing business functions[1]. The most successful firms view AI as an augmentation tool that requires rigorous human oversight, embraces ethical safeguards, and commits to continuous cultural evolution. By doing so, they position themselves to thrive in a rapidly shifting legal landscape.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Sources\\n\\n[1] 3 Ways Lawyers Are Finding New Efficiencies With AI — Above the Law  \\n[2] The Impact of AI on Legal Ethics Law: Challenges and Best Practices — CallidusAI  \\n[3] AI in Practice: Using Design Thinking to build a culture of innovation for the AI era — Thomson Reuters\",\"generationInfo\":{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}}]]},\"tokenUsage\":{\"completionTokens\":800,\"promptTokens\":8836,\"totalTokens\":9636}}}"}}
