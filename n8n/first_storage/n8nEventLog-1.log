rules are triggered when the ADMT is applied to make “significant decisions.”\\\\n\\\\nAs an important development in U.S. AI regulation, California enacted its automated decisionmaking technology (ADMT) rules in September 2025. These are the first enacted, broadly scoped, consumer-facing AI governance rules in the country. They offer opt-out rights and logic disclosures for AI-driven significant decisions affecting consumers. The rules took effect on October 1, 2025, with compliance required by January 1, 2027, for covered businesses that use ADMT in significant decisions before that date.\\\\n\\\\n### **Background**\\\\n\\\\nCalifornia has long led the nation in privacy regulation. As privacy is a main component of AI governance, the California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA) was authorized to regulate AI systems that use personal data to make significant decisions under the California Privacy Rights Act in 2020, as an amendment to the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). After years of drafting and public input, the CPPA finalized the ADMT rules as part of a [rulemaking package](https://cppa.ca.gov/regulations/pdf/ccpa_updates_cyber_risk_admt_appr_text.pdf), alongside new provisions related to cybersecurity audits and risk assessments.\\\\n\\\\nAmong the package, the ADMT rules stood out for their early conceptual drafting, heightened public scrutiny and substantive revisions—driven by the rise of generative AI in late 2022 and the urgency to address opaque, consumer-facing algorithmic decisions. The CPPA leveraged its existing privacy authority to sidestep legislative gridlock and deliver the first enforceable privacy-based AI governance regulations.\\\\n\\\\n### **Scope of the ADMT Rules**\\\\n\\\\nThe ADMT rules apply to CCPA-covered entities—for-profit entities doing business in California that collect personal information and meet one of the statutory thresholds. In its final form, ADMT is defined to apply to “any technology that processes personal information and uses computation to replace human decisionmaking or substantially replace human decisionmaking.” The computation generally involves machine learning as a form of AI.\\\\n\\\\nThe ADMT rules are triggered when the ADMT is applied to make “significant decisions.” Significant decisions include financial or lending services, housing, education enrollment or opportunities, employment or independent contracting opportunities or compensation, and healthcare services. Therefore, examples of applying ADMT to make significant decisions include using AI tools to automatically screen and reject applicants for employment, school admission, credit or housing.\\\\n\\\\n### **Compliance Obligations by Stage**\\\\n\\\\nThe figure below summarizes how a business should comply with the rules around each use of ADMT. Overall, businesses must notify consumers before any use of ADMT, explain how it works and provide meaningful opt-out and appeal rights. In doing so, a business honors the consumer rights afforded by the ADMT rules.\\\\n\\\\n![Image 10](blob:http://localhost/160bdd14e0be7498e49d84b3fff0ff2b)\\\\n\\\\nSpecifically, as illustrated in the figure:\\\\n\\\\nBefore applying ADMT, businesses must (1) conduct a pre-use risk assessment to demonstrate understanding of what the ADMT is doing, what kinds of personal information it processes and what the foreseeable impacts are on consumers. The business must also (2) provide pre-use notice to all consumers that describes at least the business purpose, inputs, logic, outputs, final outcomes and the opt-out and appeal processes of the ADMT, as well as how decisions would be made in the absence of ADMT. Moreover, businesses must (3) establish opt-out mechanisms that provide two or more easy-to-use methods to submit requests, such as an online form accessible via the pre-use notice and a designated email address.\\\\n\\\\nWhile applying ADMT, businesses must (4) handle opt-out requests and cease applying ADMT to make a significant decision for the requesting consumers as necessary. They must also (5) respond to access requests concerning making significant decisions related to specific users by clarifying the purpose, logic, parameters, outputs, final outcomes or future uses of the ADMT.\\\\n\\\\nAfter applying ADMT, businesses must (6) handle appeals of significant decisions related to specific consumers through a human reviewer who must analyze the ADMT output alongside other relevant information and may revise the significant decision as appropriate. Furthermore, they must (7) perform risk assessments periodically or responsive to material changes in processing activities to ensure that the business’ use of ADMT functions as intended and does not unlawfully discriminate.\\\\n\\\\n### **Comparison and Implications**\\\\n\\\\nThe ADMT rules establish safeguards for businesses applying ADMT to make significant decisions affecting consumers by requiring businesses to be transparent, careful and accountable in their use of ADMT. Covered businesses should start familiarizing themselves with the compliance steps involved in developing or acquiring any ADMT and recognize that compliance with the rules will allow them to best serve consumers responsibly while leveraging ADMT.\\\\n\\\\nCompared with the closest state AI laws from Colorado, which apply to high-risk AI systems in consequential decisions, the ADMT rules offer more extensive consumer rights and specifically cover profiling rooted in privacy concerns. The ADMT rules may thus serve as a model for other states seeking to regulate AI in ways that ensure fairness, transparency and accountability for consumers.\\\\n\\\\n### **For More Information**\\\\n\\\\nIf you have any questions about this _Alert_, please contact [Agatha H.

with human values demand scrutiny. By introducing an active learning approach, selectively retraining AI models to handle uncertain or underrepresented scenarios, research demonstrates significant improvements in safety and fairness, particularly in scenarios involving physical safety and online harms. Case studies involving multimodal embodied agents in household environments and promoting respectful dialogue online illustrate how targeted training can create more reliable and ethically aligned AI systems. The findings underscore the necessity for policymakers and technologists to collaborate closely, ensuring AI is thoughtfully designed, context sensitive, and genuinely aligned with human priorities, promoting safer and more equitable outcomes across society.\\\\n\\\\nIntroduction\\\\n------------\\\\n\\\\nArtificial intelligence has quickly transitioned from speculative fiction into a reality deeply embedded in everyday life, significantly changing the way we work, communicate, and make important decisions. What once existed primarily in research laboratories is now widely used across various fields, from health care to education to creative industries. Leaders such as Anthropic CEO [Dario Amodei](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/28/ai-jobs-white-collar-unemployment-anthropic) and Meta CEO [Mark Zuckerberg](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quickerbettertech/2025/01/26/business-tech-news-zuckerberg-says-ai-will-replace-mid-level-engineers-soon/) have suggested that AI could soon replace rather than merely assist human roles, even those requiring specialized expertise. This shift in AI’s role, from supportive assistant toward autonomous agents, raises critical questions about readiness of the technology and its alignment with human values. In his book, “[The Alignment Problem: Machine Learning and Human Values](https://jaapl.org/content/jaapl/52/2/274.full.pdf),” Brian Christian introduces the concepts of thin and thick alignment. Thin alignment refers to AI systems superficially meeting human-specified criteria, whereas thick alignment emphasizes a deeper, contextual understanding of human values and intentions. This distinction closely mirrors the central concern of this article, highlighting why we must ensure AI systems not only perform tasks correctly but also genuinely reflect nuanced and diverse human needs, priorities, and values across different real-world scenarios.\\\\n\\\\nThe values of alignment may be very different depending on the use case, particularly with AI promising remarkable breakthroughs across sectors, from assistive technology in education to supporting patients in health care. Alignment in safety needs to encompass likelihood and impact of harm, be it physical, psychological, economic, or societal. Residual risks must be understood, proportionate, and controllable; for example, when robots assist the elderly we may prioritize physical safety, while in online environments we may prioritize psychological wellbeing. As policymakers across the world roll out AI regulations, such as the [EU AI Act](https://commission.europa.eu/news-and-media/news/ai-act-enters-force-2024-08-01_en), the [Korean Basic AI act](https://www.shinkim.com/eng/media/newsletter/2667), and the [Workforce of the Future Act of 2024](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/5031) in the U.S., these alignment values may vary. Dr. Alondra Nelson, former director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, asked the critical question in a 2023 [keynote address](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sq_XwqVTqvQ&t=2432s): “how we can build AI models and systems and tools in a way that’s compatible with . . . human values.”\\\\n\\\\nThe central question then becomes not just whether AI is aligned with universal human values but whether it is aligned to our specific and varied human needs. Ensuring AI alignment for new scenarios or particular requirements is challenging. General AI learns from training data, using statistical probabilities—such as the likelihood of a safety concern—to inform its decisions. But these probabilities in training data may not reflect alignment in safety levels required in different scenarios. As the real world has countless possible scenarios, it is perhaps unreasonable to expect that AI would learn the probabilities in a perfect way to operate in all possible environments. In her [work](https://www.ted.com/talks/yejin_choi_why_ai_is_incredibly_smart_and_shockingly_stupid), computer scientist Dr. Yejin Choi observes that AI models can be “incredibly smart and shockingly stupid,” as they can still fail at basic tasks. Dr. Choi goes on to suggest benefits of training smaller models that are more closely aligned with human norms and values.\\\\n\\\\nSmaller and specialized AI models could be the solution to the problem of misaligned AI. By [rebalancing or changing the data distribution](https://aclanthology.org/2022.emnlp-main.779.pdf) that an AI learns from, its behavior can be adapted to reduce errors. One such technique is [active learning](https://burrsettles.com/pub/settles.activelearning.pdf), which can be used to direct AI systems to fix their behavior by showing examples that the AI might be failing on. By repeatedly identifying and refining these uncertain points across many different parts of the data, we can gradually build models that better reflect the diverse necessities of human-AI interactions.\\\\n\\\\nTo further explore this idea, we conducted two case studies—one in a household safety environment with [embodied agents](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3709347.3743614) and one to promote respectful content [online](https://aclanthology.org/2025.coling-main.362/). Our intention was not only to improve model performance but to evaluate whether the approach could lead to safer and fairer alignments for AI. Not only did our models make fewer mistakes but the active‐learning process itself revealed how targeted, data‐driven interventions can be used—both technically and in policy—to foster a healthier, more trustworthy, and better aligned AI ecosystem.\\\\n\\\\nActive learning framework\\\\n-------------------------\\\\n\\\\nIn real life, we rarely know exactly how our data are distributed—who has which health conditions, what ages or backgrounds they come from, or how safety rules differ by region. That makes it easy for a general AI to encounter situations it wasn’t trained for and then fail in unexpected ways. When developing these AI models, we would not know what exactly we should look for. Should we try to have a balanced representation of mental health conditions or physical health conditions? Which dimensions should we prioritize? As such, we need a method that can take an AI model and shift its learned probabilities to account for novel or uncommon scenarios for specific applications.\\\\n\\\\nWhile there can be different approaches to addressing this problem, we focus on changing the model behavior by showing samples to the AI where it may lack proper representation. We begin by selecting an AI model we want to improve, with the goal of aligning it in new scenarios. The model enters a continuous loop where it generates output on instances from diverse regions in data. An auxiliary model detects instances that the model is likely failing on (e.g., it is not promoting safety when responding to a post supporting self-harm). When such instances arise, an external, more powerful language model is employed to help annotate these challenging examples. These newly labeled examples are then added to the training data, allowing the model to update its knowledge and improve over time. This approach in our framework follows the principles of [clustering-based active learning](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-acl.342/#:~:text=In%20this%20paper%2C%20we%20propose%20a%20novel%20adaptive,efforts%20in%20response%20to%20an%20estimated%20classifier%20error-rate.).\\\\n\\\\nThis approach, however, has a critical challenge. How do we know that a model is uncertain about an instance? Measuring a generative AI model’s uncertainty is very [complex](https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-main.611/) as it can generate many possible outputs. To address this, we introduce an auxiliary model that transforms the model’s output into a numerical score depending on the desired behavior. We believe this approach can be useful to policymakers and other stakeholders, who can adjust this score to align AI with desired values and principles.\\\\n\\\\nCase studies of safety alignment\\\\n--------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nIn our work, we consider two case studies where AI may need to be adapted for improved safety. While the first case study focuses on physical safety, the second focuses on online safety. In [the first case study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.14141), we study physical safety in household environments in the presence of embodied agents and in the second case study, we target [promoting healthier dialogue](https://aclanthology.org/2025.coling-main.362/) on social media.\\\\n\\\\n### Case study 1: Alignment of safety in multimodal embodied agents\\\\n\\\\nAI is already changing the limits of how we interact with technology. We are already seeing [autonomous taxis](https://www.axios.com/2023/08/29/cities-testing-self-driving-driverless-taxis-robotaxi-waymo), [drones for food delivery](https://www.ourcrowd.com/learn/drone-food-delivery), and robots to deliver documents in [hospitals](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10914788). The next frontier of AI is set to be multimodal agents deployed with embodied agents. It is very likely that in the future robots will assist us in our everyday life with household tasks like cooking. We are not far away from the science fiction world of [Isaac Asimov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov), and we have to think about whether these robots can operate safely around us. For example, a robot helping the elderly must prioritize safety of the user, even if the elderly person is reluctant about it. Equipping large language or multimodal models with robots can make them very capable. However, in an investigation of “AI biology,” [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/research/tracing-thoughts-language-model) found that language models can make up fake reasoning to show to users. As such, language models, when deployed with assistive robots, could overlook or not provide proper responses in safety-critical scenarios.\\\\n\\\\nRecognizing the potential of multimodal AI agents deployed with robots, in our [recent work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14141) we present a framework for a multimodal dialogue system, M-CoDAL. M-CoDAL is specifically designed for embodied agents to better understand and communicate in safety-critical situations. To train this system, we first obtain potential safety violations from a given image (we obtain hundreds of safety-related images from Reddit, which is [well known](https://aclanthology.org/2023.eacl-main.276/) for its diversity of input). This is then followed by turns of dialogues between the user and the system. During training, we follow the concept of clustering-based active learning mechanism that utilizes an external large language model (LLM) to identify informative instances. These instances are then used to train a smaller language model that holds conversations about the safety violation in the image.\\\\n\\\\nIn our results, we observe that when clustering-based active learning is used, the safety score increases to 82.03 from baseline of 79.95 on a 0-100 scale, using just 200 safety violation images, while also improving the sentiment and resolution score. While the sentiment and resolution scores are lower than GPT-4o, a well-known LLM, the safety score is substantially higher than GPT-4o (78.65). By default, GPT-4o may simply agree with the user, thereby preserving sentiment or resolution scores at the expense of safety. Our dialogue system, M-CoDAL on the other hand, prioritizes safety.\\\\n\\\\nFigure 1\\\\n\\\\n*   [](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Persuasiveness%2C+competence%2C+and+discomfort+scores+indicated+by+participants+in+the+user+study&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brookings.edu%2Finteractive%2Fpersuasiveness-competence-and-discomfort-scores-indicated-by-participants-in-the-user-study%2F%3Fr%3D1832558%26b%3D1)\\\\n*   [](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brookings.edu%2Finteractive%2Fpersuasiveness-competence-and-discomfort-scores-indicated-by-participants-in-the-user-study%2F%3Fr%3D1832558%26b%3D1&title=Persuasiveness%2C+competence%2C+and+discomfort+scores+indicated+by+participants+in+the+user+study)\\\\n*   [](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brookings.edu%2Finteractive%2Fpersuasiveness-competence-and-discomfort-scores-indicated-by-participants-in-the-user-study%2F%3Fr%3D1832558%26b%3D1&title=Persuasiveness%2C+competence%2C+and+discomfort+scores+indicated+by+participants+in+the+user+study)\\\\n*   [](https://bsky.app/intent/compose?text=Persuasiveness%2C+competence%2C+and+discomfort+scores+indicated+by+participants+in+the+user+study%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brookings.edu%2Finteractive%2Fpersuasiveness-competence-and-discomfort-scores-indicated-by-participants-in-the-user-study%2F%3Fr%3D1832558%26b%3D1)\\\\n*   [](https://threads.net/intent/post?text=Persuasiveness%2C+competence%2C+and+discomfort+scores+indicated+by+participants+in+the+user+study%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brookings.edu%2Finteractive%2Fpersuasiveness-competence-and-discomfort-scores-indicated-by-participants-in-the-user-study%2F%3Fr%3D1832558%26b%3D1)\\\\n*   [](https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brookings.edu%2Finteractive%2Fpersuasiveness-competence-and-discomfort-scores-indicated-by-participants-in-the-user-study%2F%3Fr%3D1832558%26b%3D1&title=Persuasiveness%2C+competence%2C+and+discomfort+scores+indicated+by+participants+in+the+user+study)\\\\n*   [](mailto:?subject=https://www.brookings.edu:%20Persuasiveness%2C%20competence%2C%20and%20discomfort%20scores%20indicated%20by%20participants%20in%20the%20user%20study&body=Persuasiveness%2C%20competence%2C%20and%20discomfort%20scores%20indicated%20by%20participants%20in%20the%20user%20study%0D%0A%0D%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.brookings.edu%2Finteractive%2Fpersuasiveness-competence-and-discomfort-scores-indicated-by-participants-in-the-user-study%2F%3Fr%3D1832558%26b%3D1)\\\\n\\\\nWe set up a study where every participant tried out two different systems in a 2X2 within-subjects design where we varied both the type of language model used, as well as severeity of safety violation. Participants interacted with a robot powered by either GPT-4o or a robot powered by our proposed M-CoDAL system in two severity scenarios. In the low-severity scenario, participants left twisted cables on a table and in the high-severity scenario, they placed a knife at the edge of a table. Fake tools and appliances were used so that no hazardous situations are created for the participants. Figure 1 shows the results of the study where we observed that there was a significant difference between how persuasive the participants found the two models (χ² = 15.972, p = 0.001).\\\\n\\\\n### **Case Study 2: Alignment in promoting healthier dialogue on social media**\\\\n\\\\nHarmful or offensive text, particularly on social media, has been a persistent concern over the years. Such content includes hate speech (for example slurs targeting racial or religious groups), harassment or bullying directed at individuals, and misinformation with potentially severe psychosocial consequences (for example misleading claims about climate change). Exposure to these kinds of harmful content can significantly affect the [psychological wellbeing](https://www.adl.org/resources/report/online-hate-and-harassment-american-experience-2021) of adolescents and young people, leading to anxiety, existential distress, or feelings of helplessness.\\\\n\\\\nSocial media platforms have adopted numerous approaches to limit this harm. On platforms such as [Reddit](https://aclanthology.org/2023.eacl-main.276.pdf), human moderators play a crucial role in removing slurs, targeted harassment, or violent content that violates community policies. Twitter has deployed community notes, which allow users to collaboratively add context to potentially misleading posts such as those spreading false or distorted information about climate science. Facebook has [followed suit](https://www.ft.com/content/7693fb45-4981-4f00-bfdf-4ce7a93349f7?), discontinuing its centralized fact checking system and adopting a user driven community notes system, a change that has drawn [backlash](https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338471/meta-hate-speech-hateful-conduct-policy-moderation?utm_source=chatgpt.com) from users and advocacy groups concerned about its effectiveness, consistency, and risk of bias.\\\\n\\\\nOther alternative approaches have also been suggested such as [paraphrasing](https://aclanthology.org/2022.coling-1.530.pdf) text to remove offensiveness or to [counter](https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.110.pdf) offensive texts on social media. There is a longstanding notion that more speech can counteract harmful speech, with U.S. Supreme Court Justice[Louis Brandeis](https://firstamendmentwatch.org/history-speaks-brandeis-concurring-holmes-whitney-v-california-1927/) declaring in 1927 that “the remedy to be applied is more speech, not enforced silence.” As such, we consider the task of generating “counter-narratives.” Counter-narratives, also referred to as counterspeech, are broadly defined as statements that pose opposing views to offensive or hateful content. [Previous studies](https://www.dangerousspeech.org/libraries/considerations-for-successful-counterspeech) have shown that counter-narratives have been effective in battling hateful content.\\\\n\\\\nFigure 2\\\\n\\\\n*   [](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Error+ratios+in+responding+to+offensiveness+toward+under-represented+groups&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brookings.edu%2Finteractive%2Ferror-ratios-in-responding-to-offensiveness-toward-under-represented-groups%2F%3Fr%3D1832558%26b%3D1)\\\\n*   [](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brookings.edu%2Finteractive%2Ferror-ratios-in-responding-to-offensiveness-toward-under-represented-groups%2F%3Fr%3D1832558%26b%3D1&title=Error+ratios+in+responding+to+offensiveness+toward+under-represented+groups)\\\\n*   [](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brookings.edu%2Finteractive%2Ferror-ratios-in-responding-to-offensiveness-toward-under-represented-groups%2F%3Fr%3D1832558%26b%3D1&title=Error+ratios+in+responding+to+offensiveness+toward+under-represented+groups)\\\\n*   [](https://bsky.app/intent/compose?text=Error+ratios+in+responding+to+offensiveness+toward+under-represented+groups%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brookings.edu%2Finteractive%2Ferror-ratios-in-responding-to-offensiveness-toward-under-represented-groups%2F%3Fr%3D1832558%26b%3D1)\\\\n*   [](https://threads.net/intent/post?text=Error+ratios+in+responding+to+offensiveness+toward+under-represented+groups%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brookings.edu%2Finteractive%2Ferror-ratios-in-responding-to-offensiveness-toward-under-represented-groups%2F%3Fr%3D1832558%26b%3D1)\\\\n*   [](https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brookings.edu%2Finteractive%2Ferror-ratios-in-responding-to-offensiveness-toward-under-represented-groups%2F%3Fr%3D1832558%26b%3D1&title=Error+ratios+in+responding+to+offensiveness+toward+under-represented+groups)\\\\n*   [](mailto:?subject=https://www.brookings.edu:%20Error%20ratios%20in%20responding%20to%20offensiveness%20toward%20under-represented%20groups&body=Error%20ratios%20in%20responding%20to%20offensiveness%20toward%20under-represented%20groups%0D%0A%0D%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.brookings.edu%2Finteractive%2Ferror-ratios-in-responding-to-offensiveness-toward-under-represented-groups%2F%3Fr%3D1832558%26b%3D1)\\\\n\\\\nCounter-narratives can play a critical role in moderating on social media platforms. AI-generated counter-narratives can effectively reduce human exposure and psychological strain by responding directly to harmful speech. Further, counter-narratives can be deployed [with fact-checking mechanisms](https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2024/01/countering-disinformation-effectively-an-evidence-based-policy-guide?lang=en) to debunk misinformation. The varied nature of social media platforms with different communities, however, poses a challenging environment to these AI models. [Meng et al.](https://aclanthology.org/2023.eacl-main.276/) (2023) point out that rules governing acceptable content vary widely across online communities—for example, medical advice might be appropriate on one part of Reddit such as r/MedicalAdvice but inappropriate on another part of Reddit such as r/FinancialAdvice. Therefore, AI-generated counter-narratives must be carefully tailored to specific community guidelines and contexts.\\\\n\\\\nTo address this, our experiment aimed to equip a pre-trained language model to generate counter-narratives in diverse scenarios. We set up our experiment by first combining a dataset from [Reddit](https://aclanthology.org/2025.coling-main.362/) and a dataset compiled by [NGO workers](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.250/). This dataset contains offensive language targeting different groups such as persons of color, women, or immigrants. To generate counter-narratives for these offensive texts, we fine-tune Flan-T5, an instruction-tuned large language model with relatively small size. We allocate the same number of training data, acquired either through standard random sampling or through our proposed method. From Figure 2, we can observe that the original data had very low frequency groups such as people of color (POC). Standard fine-tuning with random sampling results in a high error rate for these classes. Our proposed method, on the other hand, has a more uniform error distribution, with errors for low-frequency groups such as people of color substantially reduced from 52% to 30%. Aggregated, our proposed approach has overall accuracy of 75.8% while standard random sampling has overall accuracy of 65.0%. This suggests that a general-purpose model language model can be more effectively tuned for specific tasks with our approach.\\\\n\\\\nPolicy implications\\\\n-------------------\\\\n\\\\nAs AI systems become more deeply embedded in high-stakes scenarios, recent legislative and policy developments underscore the urgency of implementing concrete AI safety frameworks. At the federal level, the [Take It Down Act](https://time.com/7277746/ai-deepfakes-take-it-down-act-2025/), passed in April 2025, specifically addresses harms from AI-generated deepfakes and non-consensual imagery. It requires platforms to remove reported content within 48 hours, establishing accountability for AI misuse in digital spaces. This move demonstrates a clear acknowledgment by lawmakers of the psychological and reputational harms posed by generative AI.\\\\n\\\\nSimilarly, the [Workforce of the Future Act of 2024](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/5031) (S.5031) empowers agencies like the Department of Labor and the National Science Foundation to prepare the workforce for AI disruption. It supports programs that reskill workers and integrate AI literacy into early education, aligning with our proposed framework that adapts AI to specific, high-stakes domains.\\\\n\\\\nAt the state level, the [Colorado Artificial Intelligence Act](https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb24-205) (SB24-205) will take effect in February 2026. It mandates disclosures when AI is used and prohibits discriminatory outcomes in automated decisions. Notably, it follows a risk-based model inspired by the EU’s AI Act, offering a pragmatic regulatory approach for broader adoption. In the state of New York, the [Artificial Intelligence Bill of Rights](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/A3265) (A3265) proposes resident protections against opaque AI decision making, reinforcing transparency and fairness in automated systems.\\\\n\\\\nInternationally, in [May 2024,](https://datamatters.sidley.com/2024/06/06/one-step-closer-ai-act-approved-by-council-of-the-eu/) the EU [approved](https://datamatters.sidley.com/2024/06/06/one-step-closer-ai-act-approved-by-council-of-the-eu/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) its[landmark AI Act](https://commission.europa.eu/news-and-media/news/ai-act-enters-force-2024-08-01_en), classifying AI systems by risk level and imposing strict requirements—such as mandatory impact assessments for “high-risk” applications in healthcare, transportation, and law enforcement. Enacted in August 2024, it establishes a central AI Safety Committee, mandates transparency around model architectures and training data, and sets penalties for safety lapses in consumer-facing AI products. South Korea passed the [AI Basic Act](https://www.shinkim.com/eng/media/newsletter/2667) in December 2024, with risk-based provisions for high-impact AI systems [scheduled to take effect](https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/south-korea-ai-law-2025/) in [January, 2026](https://artificialintelligenceact.com/south-korean-ai-basic-law/). . It also mandates that overseas AI providers exceeding revenue or user thresholds appoint a domestic representative to oversee safety assurance reports and ensure compliance with trust requirements.\\\\n\\\\nThese efforts reflect a growing international consensus that AI alignment must be context-sensitive, transparent, adaptable and aligned with local requirements—precisely the kind of framework we have outlined in our work. Taken together, national policies and technical research can foster an ecosystem in which AI is not only powerful but also demonstrably aligned with different human experiences.\\\\n\\\\nConclusions\\\\n-----------\\\\n\\\\nAs we navigate the extraordinary pace of AI advancement, it is becoming clear that our enthusiasm for innovation needs to be tempered by caution. The promise of AI is deeply intertwined with questions of safety, fairness, and alignment with human values. By exploring active learning frameworks, we discovered practical methods to identify and correct AI misalignment, significantly improving performance in both physical and online safety scenarios.\\\\n\\\\nOur studies in multimodal embodied agents demonstrate that AI can become more effective and safer when tailored to specific contexts, prioritizing users’ wellbeing even when faced with complex scenarios. Similarly, in addressing harmful online speech, our approach not only improves the overall performance but also provides a safer way of aligning with different communities on social media.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, technical advances alone will not resolve all concerns around AI’s integration into our daily lives. Meaningful progress also demands thoughtful policymaking, careful oversight, and continued public dialogue. The recent wave of legislation in the U.S. and internationally reflects a growing acknowledgment of AI’s impact, setting crucial foundations for transparency, accountability, and ethical usage.\\\\n\\\\nLooking ahead, researchers, policymakers, and community leaders must continue collaborating closely, recognizing that AI alignment is always context specific. We must embrace approaches that balance technical innovation with ethical responsibility, always considering who benefits from these technologies and who might be left behind. Through careful attention and deliberate action, we can guide AI toward genuinely supporting human experiences, ensuring it remains an empowering force rather than a disruptive one. Our work shows that we do have the right tools for aligning AI with human values of safety. Echoing Dr. Yejin Choi’s insights, smaller models can indeed be aligned with the values of individuals and entities, whether they are patients or doctors or businesses, given that right policies and governance are in place.\\\\n\\\\nRelated Content\\\\n\\\\n[Making AI work for schools](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/making-ai-work-for-schools/)\\\\n\\\\n![Image 23: Children in classroom using laptops and tablets connected by AI](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Shutterstock_2548605069.jpg?quality=75&w=500)\\\\n\\\\n[Artificial Intelligence](https://www.brookings.edu/topics/artificial-intelligence/) Making AI work for schools \\\\nSofoklis Goulas\\\\n\\\\nJuly 31, 2025\\\\n\\\\n[Is generative AI a job killer?

For startups, scaleups, and micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), it is not only a tool to cut costs and improve efficiency, but also a driver of innovation, new business models, and market expansion.  Small tech startups, the backbone of the digital economy, are using AI to improve their workflows and develop new apps, copilots, and enterprise solutions to today’s challenges.\\\\n\\\\nYet the benefits of AI are being held back in the European Union (EU) and United Kingdom (UK) by a “regulate first, innovate later” approach. Instead of accelerating adoption, *ex-ante* rules are creating bottlenecks that slow access to frontier AI models, delay product launches, and hike compliance costs.\\\\n\\\\nThis report draws on two surveys, commissioned by ACT | The App Association and conducted by TechnoMetrica, of more than 1,000 technology MSMEs across the European Union (EU), United Kingdom (UK), and United States (U.S.). The surveys sampled AI users (respondents adopting and integrating AI tools into their operations) and AI developers (respondents building AI models, apps, or services) on their perspectives for AI adoption and growth, and the policy environment. The results reveal a widening transatlantic opportunity gap. While U.S. MSMEs have the flexibility to move faster, integrate deeper, and monetize better, their peers in the EU/UK face regulatory delays, lost clients, and rising costs.\\\\n\\\\n## Download the Full U.S. Survey Results\\\\n\\\\n## [Download the Full EU & UK Survey Results](https://actonline.org/wp-content/uploads/ACT-Europe-Artificial-Intelligence-Survey-Report-September-2025.pdf)\\\\n\\\\n### Top three takeaways:\\\\n\\\\n* **Delays shrink savings and rack up costs:** EU and UK tech startups, scaleups, and SMEs lose on average €94K / £81K / $109K – €322K / £280K/ $375K annually per firm from delayed AI models and launches; for directly affected small-tech firms, the loss rises to €160K / £139K / $186K – €453K / £393K / $528K. More U.S. SMEs (91 vs. 85 percent) are realizing greater cost savings (10.7 vs. 8.9 percent) than their EU/UK counterparts.\\\\n* **EU and UK are falling behind:** Only half of EU and UK startups actively use AI, compared to nearly two-thirds in the U.S.\\\\n* **Regulation drives delays and downgrades**: Six in 10 EU and UK tech startups and SMEs face delayed access to frontier AI models. Nearly 60 percent of EU and UK developers report launch delays, and more than one-third are forced to strip or downgrade features to comply.\\\\n\\\\n### Digging deeper: What the data shows\\\\n\\\\nThe combined survey data, outlined below, shines a light on how businesses in the European Union and the United Kingdom encounter delayed access to frontier AI tools, heavier compliance burdens, and smaller returns on investment compared to their peers in the United States. By examining adoption patterns, regulatory consequences, and the direct financial toll of delays, we can see clearly how this form of regulation is not just slowing innovation but imposing measurable costs on startups and small tech.\\\\n\\\\n#### I:     AI Adoption & Integration\\\\n\\\\nAI is mainstream across both regions, but the United States is pulling ahead. While 62 percent of U.S. tech MSMEs actively use AI, only 50 percent of EU/UK firms do.\\\\n\\\\nLooking specifically at AI users: while 73 percent of EU/UK firms say AI is important today, just 32 percent have fully integrated it into workflows. In the United States, 83 percent say AI is important and 45 percent have fully embedded it. U.S. firms are more extensively reorganizing their business models around AI.\\\\n\\\\n#### II:   Regulatory Burden & Its Consequences\\\\n\\\\nSix in 10 EU/UK MSMEs report **delayed access to frontier AI models**, and more than a third of developers say they have had to strip or downgrade features to comply with rules. Regulations are also **slowing firms’ own launches**: 58 percent of developers report regulation-driven delays, while only 37.5 percent say they are unaffected. For those caught in these slowdowns, the consequences are real. Half report slower innovation, 45 percent face higher costs, one in three falls behind competitors, and nearly 30 percent lose clients.\\\\n\\\\nIn the United States, 44 percent of developers report launch delays tied to regulation, but most describe them as moderate. More than half, 54 percent, say they have experienced no delays at all. And unlike their European counterparts, U.S. MSMEs do not face structural barriers to accessing the latest AI models.\\\\n\\\\nThe takeaway is that in the United States, regulation is a speed bump. In the EU/UK, it is a brake, stalling both access to innovation and the ability to deliver it to market.\\\\n\\\\n> > “We’re restricted from accessing innovative new tools and features that Apple and other companies release in the U.S. and other regions. These include Apple Intelligence and iPhone Mirroring. In the EU, when these tools do arrive, they’re often late and degraded versions. Competing with the United States has never been more challenging than it is today.”\\\\n\\\\n**Mitchel Volkering**, Vaic.at, ACT | The App Association EU member\\\\n\\\\n#### III:     Quantifying the Cost of Delay[1](#note1)\\\\n\\\\nEU/UK tech MSMEs bear measurable financial losses from regulatory-driven delays.\\\\n\\\\n* **Annual Revenue at Risk (all tech MSMEs)**: $31K–$62K average lost per firm; $107K–$215K for directly affected firms.\\\\n* **Foregone Savings (users)**[2](#note2): $78K lost for a 3-month delay, rising to $313K for a 12-month delay.\\\\n* **Annual Total Impact (all tech MSMEs)**: $109K–$375K average per firm; $186K–$528K for directly affected firms.\\\\n\\\\n> > > “Policymakers often look at problems from the perspective of big companies with big resources, but their decisions affect all of us, especially MSMEs. If regulation makes it harder for our clients to innovate, it makes it harder for us and them to grow. We need a market that’s not just free, but fair and doesn’t create barriers that do not exist in major regions we compete with. Otherwise, the region as a whole will fall further behind in the tech race and more and more successful startups will leave the EU to set up shop in more competitively advantageous locations.”\\\\n\\\\n**James Hansen**, Layers Studio, ACT | The App Association UK member\\\\n\\\\n#### IV:     Comparative Insights: EU/UK vs. U.S.\\\\n\\\\nBoth regions see AI as essential, but the ability to turn adoption into results diverges. EU/UK firms are adopting AI, but U.S. firms are embedding it faster, aiming at higher-value apps, and reinvesting harder.\\\\n\\\\n* **Adoption and integration are deeper in the United States.** Nearly two-thirds of U.S. MSMEs use AI, and 45 percent have fully integrated it into workflows, compared with 50 percent and 32 percent in the EU/UK. What in Europe is still in the pilot stage is, in the U.S., becoming everyday practice.\\\\n* **U.S. developers lean toward faster-scaling apps.** Both regions build consumer apps (EU/UK 56 percent vs. U.S. 52 percent) and creative tools (54 percent vs. 53 percent), but U.S. developers lean more toward enterprise apps such as AI copilots (57 percent vs. 41 percent) and software-as-a-service (SaaS)/business tools (55 percent vs. 42 percent), which monetize faster and scale better. This signals a tilt toward profitability and recurring revenues in the United States, while European developers remain more evenly spread across niches.\\\\n* **Cost savings are larger in the U.S.** In the EU/UK, 85 percent report cost savings (8.9 percent median reduction); in the United States, 91 percent report savings cost (10.7 percent median reduction). Micro-firms, with fewer than 10 employees, highlight the gap: only 60 percent of EU/UK micro-MSMEs see savings (7.9 percent median reduction), while 76 percent of U.S. peers do (8.6 percent median reduction).\\\\n\\\\n* **U.S. MSMEs are investing more aggressively.** While MSMEs on both sides of the Atlantic are optimistic, U.S. firms are pushing harder. In the EU/UK, 89 percent of tech MSMEs plan to increase AI investment, but only 13 percent of micro-firms (with fewer than 10 employees) expect to make significant increases. In the United States, the overall share rises to 94 percent, and double the rate of micro-firms (27 percent) plan significant increases. Mid-sized U.S. firms (51–100 employees) are especially aggressive, with 42 percent significantly scaling up. Developers show a similar split: over 91 percent of European developers and 92 percent of U.S. developers plan to scale, but American developers lean more heavily toward significant jumps (33 percent vs. ~20 percent in Europe).\\\\n\\\\n> > > “We’ve already seen how trusted marketplaces convey security and scale to small business offerings, opening markets and fueling growth. Assuring Responsible AI raises the stakes and the expectations by orders of magnitude, making the stabilizing and standardizing influence of trusted platforms more important than ever before. I would be hard-pressed to find a worse time to impose DMA-style obligations. High-speed trains are not limited by their engines. It’s the quality and trust in the tracks that hold them back. The wrong kind of regulation will have small businesses moving at 20th-century speeds in a 21st-century race.”\\\\n\\\\n**Sebastian Holst**, Fool Me Once, LLC, ACT | The App Association U.S. member\\\\n\\\\n### Policy Recommendations\\\\n\\\\nTo close the gap and deliver on Europe’s own ambitions, policymakers should:\\\\n\\\\n1. Ensure timely access to frontier AI models for startups and SMEs.\\\\n2. Apply proportional compliance rules that reflect startup realities, not just large enterprises.\\\\n3. Expand regulatory sandboxes and testbeds to support experimentation and scaling.\\\\n4. Align AI policy with Europe’s Digital Decade goals, making startups central to digital sovereignty and competitiveness.\\\\n\\\\n### Conclusion\\\\n\\\\nEurope’s startups, scaleups, and small technology firms are increasingly constrained by ex-ante regulatory models that impose rules before products can reach the market. Laws such as the EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act), the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and the Digital Markets Act (DMA), alongside the UK’s General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR), and the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act (DMCCA), are built to preempt any weighing of harms against benefits by restricting access and front-loading compliance. Europe’s experience shows how rigid, preemptive frameworks can slow innovation and reduce competition.\\\\n\\\\nMeanwhile, U.S. startups, scaleups, and MSMEs are proving what is possible when rules focus on outcomes rather than up-front controls (*ex post*). This report outlined just a portion of the significant costs MSMEs bare because of the bright-line prohibitions Europe has placed on the complementary services MSMEs rely on to build, grow, and succeed. Without regulatory barriers that stand in the way of their access to platform-provided services, small business innovators move faster, reinvest savings, and scale innovations into recurring revenues. The results of these surveys illustrate the significant and quantifiable costs of overly broad regulation that put small business innovators’ ability to succeed and grow at great risk.\\\\n\\\\n[1] **Methodology:** These estimates reflect two approaches. **Revenue at risk** is calculated as median firm revenue ($2.15M) × share of firms losing clients (29 percent) × conservatively assumed revenue loss (5–10 percent). This outputs $31K–$62K average lost revenue across all tech SMEs, or $107K–$215K for the 29 percent directly affected subset. **Cost savings foregone** is calculated as median operating expenses ($1.75M, derived using [Eurostat’s gross operating rate of Information & Communications Services Sector of 18.5 percent](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Businesses_in_the_information_and_communication_services_sector)) × delay length (3–12 months) × a set of adjustment factors. These adjustment factors reflect (a) 85 percent of firms report cost savings from AI, (b) 60 percent report facing delays, (c) conservatively, only 50 percent of savings depend on the delayed models, and (d) firms offset roughly 30 percent of lost savings through workarounds (so we apply 70 percent). Multiplying these together (0.85 × 0.60 × 0.50 × 0.70) produces a multiplier of 0.1785, meaning that about 18 percent of operating expenses can be treated as “at risk” due to AI delays.\\\\n\\\\n[2] Cost savings foregone applies only to *AI users* (firms integrating AI into workflows). Developers are impacted differently, through revenue at risk from launch delays and feature downgrades.\\\\n\\\\n[Page load link](#)\\\\n\\\\n[Go to Top](#)\\\\n\\\\n \\\"\\n}\\n\\n{\\n  \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://bbbprograms.org/media/insights/blog/ai-risk\\\",\\n  \\\"title\\\": \\\"Understanding the Global AI Risk-Reward Ratio\\\",\\n  \\\"content\\\": \\\"The EU, an early mover in AI regulation, is now revising aspects of the GDPR and AI Act due to their restrictive effects on innovation.

Today’s global AI conversation feels similar: major powers, each with their own approach, big egos, but a shared goal of shaping AI’s future.  This year alone we have witnessed three unique positions on AI from around the globe:\\\\n\\\\n* [**EU AI Act**](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document/EPRS_ATA(2025)772906) – years in the making, comprehensive regulation, took effect earlier this month.\\\\n* [**Japan AI Act**](https://laws.e-gov.go.jp/law/507AC0000000053) – passed quickly this spring, wide-open to industry to innovate without guardrails, principles-based approach, no enforcement.\\\\n* [**U.S. AI Action Plan**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Americas-AI-Action-Plan.pdf) – developed in weeks, focused on taking leadership, private-sector collaboration, funding for research and development, and scaling back stringent regulation that can impede AI progress.\\\\n\\\\nComparing the EU and Japan's AI regulation offers lessons for the U.S. in balancing legislative, regulatory, and self-regulatory approaches. The EU, an early mover in AI regulation, is now revising aspects of the GDPR and AI Act due to their restrictive effects on innovation. Its highly regulated model, once lauded for leadership in privacy and AI oversight, is being relaxed to avoid stifling economic opportunities in the digital marketplace.    Japan, by contrast, takes a principles-based approach emphasizing free trade, trusted data flows, and international cooperation. Its new AI legislation promotes innovation through regulatory sandboxes. Notably the law includes no enforcement mechanisms, signaling a preference for flexibility over strict compliance.    So, should the U.S. be following in the EU’s or Japan’s footsteps?     One way to answer this question is by tracking for AI model development, including costs to build the models and performance impact. Global leaders must also weigh training costs against potential rewards.\\\\n\\\\n## Go, Planet! Comparing AI Model Growth\\\\n\\\\n* **Market Leadership:** As of last year, the U.S. led with 40 innovative AI models, compared to 15 in China and 3 in Europe. It is important to note that heavier EU regulation is likely to increase development costs. Japan, with $65 billion in government funding and companies like Rakuten driving innovation, has not disclosed model counts. The U.S. AI Action Plan prioritizes federal R&D and may include a dedicated strategic plan.\\\\n* **Performance Gap:** In January 2025, the top U.S. model outperformed its greatest adversary, the best Chinese models, by 9.26% and then by February, the gap narrowed to 1.70%.\\\\n* **Training Costs:** Google Gemini Ultra cost nearly $192 million to train, one of the most expensive in the U.S., while China’s Deepseek claims $6 million (a disputed figure).\\\\n\\\\nAnother critical factor is the role of regulation. Is AI regulation necessary, and if so, what kind?\\\\n\\\\n## The Power Is Yours! Comparing the Role of Regulation\\\\n\\\\nThe EU AI Act, which entered into force in August 2024, takes effect this August, and should have full applicability by August 2026. It is a risk-based legal framework prioritizing the protection of fundamental human rights and safety by imposing strict obligations based on the level of risk an AI system poses, prohibiting \\\\\\\"unacceptable risk\\\\\\\" (e.g., social scoring, manipulative techniques) and imposing strict requirements on high-risk systems (pre-market conformity assessments, robust risk management systems, human oversight, transparency, and post-market monitoring). General purpose AI models are categorized by risk (normal or systemic). The Act is being enforced by the newly created EU AI Office, with significant penalties for non-compliance (ranging from €7.5 million or 1.5% of worldwide annual turnover to €35 million or 7% of worldwide annual turnover).     The Japan AI Act approach, in contrast, is innovation-focused, promoting R&D and adoption through regulatory sandboxes. Japan’s Act is narrower than other AI laws because it homes in on generative AI and “agile governance,” thus allowing the Act to be a living, breathing document that will continue to evolve with rapid advancements in the technology. It focuses on alignment and compliance with local and international norms and references global initiatives like the Hiroshima AI Process. This approach encourages responsible governance through multi-stakeholder collaboration and alignment with international standards. The Act, which was enacted in May 2025, has no risk categories or outright bans and relies on voluntary compliance, soft law, and industry-specific regulation.    The U.S. AI Action Plan prioritizes accelerating innovation, strengthening AI infrastructure, and leading globally on AI diplomacy and security. At its core, the Action Plan emphasizes deregulation, private-sector leadership, and expedited environmental regulatory processes and procurement standards. The priority is to promote U.S. AI standards globally, engaging in international AI diplomacy, and strengthening export control strategies for transformative AI technologies with a careful eye on what our adversary, China, is doing that could hinder growth.\\\\n\\\\n## The Path Forward – Some Recommendations\\\\n\\\\n* **Foster public trust through AI leadership.** According to a [KPMG study](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lindsaykohler/2025/05/21/inside-kpmgs-global-ai-trust-study/) of more than 48,000 people in 47 countries, more than half of all people polled – about 66% – use AI regularly. In the study, 80% of participants believe the use of AI will lead to benefits. But, only 46% of people trust AI systems. More importantly, a whopping 70% believe that AI regulation is needed. Complete lack of regulation would lead to a wild west problem, but elevated levels of regulation could chill innovation. The U.S. could adopt an approach that incentivizes companies to build in necessary safety guardrails, quickly address complaints, keep error rates low, and prioritize accuracy.\\\\n* **Innovation-first with third-party accountability.** The U.S. must ensure compliance programs can equip the industry with baseline requirements and guardrails to keep companies accountable, while preserving high-reward opportunities to innovate. The U.S. must focus on accountability of high-risk AI systems and continue to enforce against misuse of AI in high-risk contexts.\\\\n* **Invest in privacy-protective approaches.** AI can significantly improve data management, making consent preferences more efficient and streamlined, enhancing cyber detection, and improving identity management and deep fake detection. Techniques like Differential Privacy, Distributed & Federated Analysis & Learning, Encrypted Computation, Synthetic Data, and Fully Homomorphic Encryption can transform data sets to make them more secure and useful. Focus should be placed on demonstrating privacy-protective practices on the underlying data and data governance prior to its use in AI models.\\\\n\\\\nAI is not a monolith. It cannot replace humans but can complement us in fulfilling our desires in the most optimal manner possible. As we continue to navigate the complexities of AI, it is crucial for our society to consider the different international models that are chiseling AI to balance innovation with regulation, while being clear-eyed that proper incentives must be in place to ensure that AI serves the best interests of society.  [Originally published in Swiss Cognitive](https://swisscognitive.ch/2025/09/16/understanding-the-global-ai-risk-reward-ratio/)\\\\n\\\\n \\\"\\n}\"],\"options\":{\"openai_api_key\":{\"lc\":1,\"type\":\"secret\",\"id\":[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"]},\"model\":\"gpt-4.1-mini\",\"timeout\":60000,\"max_retries\":2,\"configuration\":{\"baseURL\":\"https://api.openai.com/v1\",\"fetchOptions\":{}},\"model_kwargs\":{}},\"response\":{\"response\":{\"generations\":[[{\"text\":\"## The Impact of AI Regulation on Small Businesses\\n\\nAs artificial intelligence (AI) becomes integral to business operations, new regulations are reshaping how companies use and deploy AI technologies. For small businesses, understanding these regulatory impacts is critical to staying competitive and compliant in an evolving landscape.\\n\\nOne significant development is California's Automated Decisionmaking Technology (ADMT) rules, enacted in September 2025. These regulations target businesses using AI to make \\\"significant decisions\\\" affecting consumers, such as in lending, employment, housing, or healthcare. To comply, companies must conduct pre-use risk assessments, provide transparent notices explaining AI usage, offer opt-out options, and allow human appeals against AI-driven decisions. This consumer-facing regulation holds firms accountable for AI applications and enforces safeguards to protect privacy and fairness[2]. Small businesses using AI in these domains must prepare for extensive compliance efforts by January 2027, making transparency and consumer rights a top priority.\\n\\nOn the legal front, Gartner forecasts a 30% surge in technology-related legal disputes by 2028 connected to AI regulation violations, underscoring rising risks for companies that fail to meet regulatory standards[1]. This highlights the financial and reputational stakes for small businesses embracing AI without sufficient governance frameworks.\\n\\nHowever, regulatory approaches across regions vary and carry different implications. A recent survey by ACT | The App Association reveals that AI regulation in the European Union (EU) and United Kingdom (UK) imposes heavier burdens on startups and small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) compared to the United States. SMEs in the EU/UK face significant delays in accessing advanced AI models, forced feature downgrades, and compliance costs that can range from $109,000 to $375,000 annually on average per firm due to regulatory-induced postponements. These delays not only impede innovation and time-to-market but also risk loss of clients and increased costs[3]. Conversely, U.S. MSMEs benefit from a more flexible regulatory environment that encourages faster AI adoption and integration, supporting business growth and savings.\\n\\nSmall-business leaders must also be aware of the broader context of AI alignment with human values, a critical consideration underpinning many regulations. Research from Brookings stresses the necessity of aligning AI systems with context-specific human needs to enhance safety, fairness, and societal trust. Such alignment involves designing AI that comprehends nuanced human values across varied real-world scenarios and deploying frameworks that continuously fine-tune AI behavior to minimize harm, particularly in high-stakes applications[4]. As governments worldwide implement laws like the EU AI Act and others, these values-driven dimensions of AI governance become deeply embedded in compliance requirements, influencing how companies develop and deploy AI responsibly.\\n\\nIn summary, AI regulation is a double-edged sword for small businesses: it elevates the need for robust governance to avoid costly legal challenges and reputation risks, while also potentially constraining innovation through delayed access and compliance costs—especially in more heavily regulated regions like the EU and California. Small-business leaders should prioritize early adoption of transparent, risk-aware AI practices, invest in understanding region-specific compliance obligations, and follow ongoing developments in AI value alignment to build consumer trust and competitive advantage.\\n\\n### Sources\\n[1] Gartner: AI Regulation Gaps Sparks Surge in Legal Disputes — Rocking Robots  \\n[2] California Leads the Way in Consumer-Facing AI Regulation with Automated Decisionmaking Technology Rules — Duane Morris LLP  \\n[3] The Hidden Cost of AI Regulations: A Survey of EU, UK, and U.S. Companies — ACT | The App Association  \\n[4] Hype and Harm: Why We Must Ask Harder Questions About AI and Its Alignment with Human Values — Brookings\",\"generationInfo\":{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}}]]},\"tokenUsage\":{\"completionTokens\":734,\"promptTokens\":32181,\"totalTokens\":32915}}}"}}

balancing act: delivering high quality, keeping overheads low, staying agile, and growing at the same time. AI tools are no longer just a “nice to have” – when used well, they help small companies automate repetitive tasks, boost productivity, sharpen decision-making, and get more done without hiring a large team.\\\\n\\\\nBelow are some of the best AI tools available today. Each one has real impact, and many are already being used by UK small businesses.\\\\n\\\\nWhy small businesses need AI tools to stay competitive\\\\n------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nBefore diving into tools, it helps to be clear on [**what most small businesses aim to get from AI**](https://www.moneypenny.com/uk/resources/blog/10-examples-of-ai-in-customer-service/):\\\\n\\\\n*   Save time / reduce repetitive work (email drafting, scheduling, customer follow-ups)\\\\n\\\\n*   Improve customer experience (faster response times, personalised messaging)\\\\n\\\\n*   Better decisions & insights (from data, customer behaviour, markets)\\\\n\\\\n*   Scale marketing & content without big budgets\\\\n\\\\n*   Maintain flexibility / not get locked in – tools should be affordable, easy to use, integrate well\\\\n\\\\nAI tools that help small businesses scale efficiently\\\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nHere are leading tools, and what they do especially well for small businesses.\\\\n\\\\n### ChatGPT: AI content creation for small business marketing\\\\n\\\\nChatGPT, from OpenAI, is one of the most widely used AI tools in the world. For small businesses, it’s like having a digital assistant that can draft blog posts, emails, social media captions, FAQs and more in minutes.\\\\n\\\\nInstead of spending hours writing from scratch, you can use ChatGPT to generate ideas and content, then edit and adapt to match your brand’s tone. It’s not a replacement for your voice, but it can dramatically speed up content creation and free up time for other tasks.\\\\n\\\\n### Sage Copilot: AI -powered finance and admin support for small businesses\\\\n\\\\nFinance and admin can eat up valuable hours for small businesses. Sage, a UK-based provider, has introduced Sage Copilot, an AI assistant that automates tasks like invoicing, chasing late payments and payroll.\\\\n\\\\nBy cutting down on manual admin, it gives business owners more time to focus on growth while ensuring finances are handled accurately and professionally.\\\\n\\\\n### HubSpot: Smarter sales and marketing with built in AI-tools\\\\n\\\\nHubSpot has long been a favourite for growing businesses, and its AI features make it even more powerful. From automatically generating marketing content to helping sales reps with outreach, its tools are designed to align sales, marketing and customer service.\\\\n\\\\n### Otter.ai: Meeting notes and transcriptions made effortless\\\\n\\\\nTaking accurate notes during client meetings or team catch-ups can be a distraction. Otter.ai automatically records and transcribes meetings, creating searchable notes that everyone can access.\\\\n\\\\nFor small businesses, this saves time, reduces misunderstandings, and means you always have a record of what was discussed and agreed.\\\\n\\\\n### Moneypenny: Unique blend of brilliant people and AI technology driving efficiencies within companies of every shape and size, 24/7\\\\n\\\\nFor many small businesses, phone calls are still the lifeblood of growth. Every enquiry could be a new lead, booking or long-term client. But with lean teams, it’s not always possible to answer every call promptly. [**AI answering services**](https://www.moneypenny.com/uk/ai-voice-agent/) solve this by handling calls instantly, professionally and consistently.\\\\n\\\\nMoneypenny’s [**AI Voice Agent**](https://www.moneypenny.com/uk/ai-voice-agent/) is a prime example. Built with decades of call-handling expertise behind it, it uses advanced AI to answer calls naturally, capture enquiries accurately and provide a seamless experience for customers. Available 24/7, it ensures no call is ever missed, even when staff are busy or out of hours.\\\\n\\\\nWhat to watch out for\\\\n---------------------\\\\n\\\\nAI tools are powerful, but things to keep in mind:\\\\n\\\\n*   **Data protection / privacy**: Make sure any tool you use is GDPR compliant and that you control the data.\\\\n\\\\n*   **Managing expectations**: AI isn’t perfect. Prompting well, reviewing output, and incorporating your voice / brand is still necessary.\\\\n\\\\n*   **Integration**: A tool that doesn’t speak to your CRM, accounting software or website might create silos. Choose ones that plug in well.\\\\n\\\\n*   **Cost vs benefit**: Look beyond licensing fees to the time saved, additional revenue or improved customer satisfaction. Sometimes cheaper tools with fewer features but good usability are better than complex, expensive ones.\\\\n\\\\n*   **Skill gap / training**: Some teams may need support to use AI well. Make room for experimentation and iteration.\\\\n\\\\nHow to start using AI in your business\\\\n--------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nHere are steps to get started so you see return faster:\\\\n\\\\n1.   **Pick one area where you’re wasting time** – e.g. content creation, customer responses, or admin.\\\\n2.   **Trial a tool** – many of the tools above have free tiers or trial periods. Use that to test compatibility, ease of use and integration.\\\\n3.   **Set measurable goals** – e.g. reduce response times by 50%, increase leads from social media by 20%, reduce admin by X hours/week.\\\\n4.   **Train staff** – get people comfortable with using AI tools, giving feedback, understanding limitations.\\\\n5.   **Review & iterate** – what works well? What needs changing? Keep tools that deliver and fold or drop those that don’t justify their cost.\\\\n\\\\nTake action: start using AI tools to grow your business today\\\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\\\n\\\\nAI tools, once reserved for larger firms, are now accessible, affordable and highly useful for small businesses. When chosen and used well, they help you work smarter, serve customers better, and grow more sustainably.\\\\n\\\\nIf you’re considering adopting one or more of these tools, start small, aim for quick wins, and scale from there. The right mix of AI tools could be what lets your small business punch above its weight.\\\\n\\\\nWant to see how our [**AI Voice Agent**](https://www.moneypenny.com/uk/ai-voice-agent/) can support your small business?

Today’s AI-powered business tools offer small-business leaders the capability to automate repetitive tasks, enhance decision-making, and scale marketing efforts without the need for large teams or substantial budgets.\\n\\n### Why Small Businesses Need AI Tools\\n\\nSmall businesses often juggle limited resources, tight deadlines, and high customer expectations. AI tools help by:\\n\\n- Saving time through automation of routine tasks like email drafting, scheduling, and customer follow-ups.\\n- Improving customer experience via faster response times and personalized messaging.\\n- Providing actionable insights by analyzing data, customer behavior, and market trends.\\n- Scaling marketing and content creation efficiently without heavy investments.\\n- Offering flexibility with affordable, easy-to-use solutions that integrate well with existing systems[3].\\n\\n### Leading AI Tools Transforming Small Businesses\\n\\n**ChatGPT (OpenAI)** is a versatile AI tool commonly described as a \\\"Swiss Army knife\\\" for businesses. It enables rapid generation of marketing content, automates customer support by handling inquiries 24/7, assists with code writing and debugging, and provides data analysis and multilingual content capabilities. Marketing agencies report up to 60% reductions in content creation time, allowing them to serve more clients without expanding their workforce[2]. \\n\\n**Moneypenny’s AI Voice Agent** offers an AI-powered phone answering service designed specifically for small businesses. Combining sophisticated AI with human-like conversation skills, it ensures calls are answered professionally and queries captured accurately around the clock. This tool prevents missed opportunities when staff are busy or unavailable, effectively supporting lead generation and customer retention[3]. \\n\\n**Lyro AI Agent by Tidio** specializes in automating customer service, handling up to 67% of repetitive queries with human-like precision. This AI integrates smoothly with business software, enabling support teams to focus on complex issues while providing fast, consistent responses that elevate customer satisfaction. SMBs using Lyro have seen remarkable improvements in service quality and operational efficiency[4].\\n\\n**HubSpot AI and Salesforce Einstein** bring AI-driven intelligence to CRM systems. They assist in predictive lead scoring, automating data entry, and delivering personalized customer recommendations, which in turn accelerate sales cycles and improve forecast accuracy. Businesses using these tools report significant gains in sales productivity and customer engagement[3][2]. \\n\\n**Notion AI and Fireflies** improve internal collaboration by automating meeting notes, organizing project data, and facilitating knowledge management. These tools can reduce miscommunications and speed project completion times, essential for small teams working across remote or hybrid environments[2][4].\\n\\n### Implementing AI in Your Business\\n\\nStarting small is key. Identify your biggest time-draining tasks—whether content creation, customer follow-ups, or admin—and trial AI tools with free tiers or trials. Set measurable goals such as reducing response times or increasing lead generation, train your team to use these tools effectively, and regularly review their impact[3][2].\\n\\n### Cautions and Considerations\\n\\nWhile AI is powerful, it still requires human oversight. Ensure compliance with data protection laws like GDPR, manage expectations around AI’s limitations, and prioritize tools that integrate well into your workflow to avoid siloed data. Balance the cost of AI tools with tangible benefits like saved time, improved customer service, and increased revenue to maximize ROI[3][4].\\n\\nAdopting AI-powered tools not only levels the playing field for small businesses but can propel them ahead of competitors by enabling smarter workflows, better customer interactions, and faster business growth in 2025 and beyond.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Sources\\n\\n[1] Grow Your Business with AI-Powered Tools by Google — YouTube  \\n[2] 10 Game-Changing AI Tools That Will 10X Your Business Growth | Level Up Coding  \\n[3] The Best AI Tools for Small Business Growth | Moneypenny  \\n[4] 25 Best AI Tools for Work: What to Use to Get Ahead [2025] | Tidio\",\"generationInfo\":{\"finish_reason\":\"stop\"}}]]},\"tokenUsage\":{\"completionTokens\":821,\"promptTokens\":43527,\"totalTokens\":44348}}}"}}

The top reason firms adopt legal-specific AI tools, for example, is integration with a trusted service provider, and firmwide adoption slightly slowed from 2023-24, according to the report.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, organizations that adopt AI tools are seeing big benefits; 61% of these firms report improved efficiency, while 21% report significant improvements.\\\\n\\\\nLawyers are using AI to reduce non-billable hours on tasks like email drafting and file review. Firms are seeing faster client intake, better data analysis, and improved payment collections.\\\\n\\\\nAt the same time, firms that are slow to adopt risk falling behind competitors who leverage AI for both legal and business operations.\\\\n\\\\nHere, we look at three areas where firms are finding efficiency and productivity gains with AI. If you’d like to see how your firm could benefit, [you can learn more here.](https://www.8am.com/ai/)\\\\n\\\\n**Legal Research and Writing**\\\\n\\\\nIn what is perhaps its most transformative application for the legal industry, generative AI has eliminated countless tedious hours from the drafting and research process.\\\\n\\\\nAs noted by [Nicole Black of 8am](https://bit.ly/4gVLLbs), an Above the Law contributor, the technology has reshaped numerous tasks in this area.\\\\n\\\\nAI can create outlines for memos and pleadings to organize your research and writing. It can evaluate briefs and offer suggestions on improving their persuasiveness, and it can quickly find answers to general legal questions.\\\\n\\\\nIts other functions are as varied as generating questions for depositions, summarizing case law and statutes, brainstorming legal arguments, and translating between languages in real time.\\\\n\\\\nCheck out these [prompt ideas](https://bit.ly/4pYOhBT) from 8am.\\\\n\\\\n**Document and Data Management**\\\\n\\\\nLawyers live and work in documents, spending a great deal of their time editing, retrieving, storing, and extracting information from them.\\\\n\\\\nThis is one area particularly ripe for time savings, and AI tools have transformed these processes for the firms that utilize them.\\\\n\\\\nAs noted in the 2025 Legal Industry Report, document summarization and data extraction are top-priority AI features.\\\\n\\\\nLaw firms are using these tools for tasks as varied as reviewing and summarizing contracts, extracting key terms for deal management, and drafting document templates. Capabilities that platforms like [8am MyCase](https://bit.ly/4pYOTYn) bring together for modern firms.\\\\n\\\\nSome are using these tools to translate contracts and client communications. They can also summarize deposition transcripts and medical records, which is particularly useful in personal injury and immigration practices.\\\\n\\\\n**Law Firm Operations**\\\\n\\\\nLawyers are also adopting AI to transform workflows like billing and scheduling — not just their legal tasks.\\\\n\\\\nThe text generation features can be used to draft marketing copy, blog posts, and social media content, as well as to create client-facing items like intake forms or FAQs.\\\\n\\\\nAI can particularly [improve a firm’s financial wellness](https://abovethelaw.com/2025/09/how-8am-lawpay-takes-the-sting-out-of-legal-billing/) as well.\\\\n\\\\nIt can help grow your bottom line by easing the collections process and eliminating administrative burdens.\\\\n\\\\nThese systems can also analyze your firm’s data to help you spot important trends, make evidence-based management decisions, and maximize profitability.\\\\n\\\\nAI tools will manage workflows and calendaring with ease, further eliminating tedious work and allowing lawyers to focus on high-level strategy.\\\\n\\\\n**How Your Firm Can Move Ahead**\\\\n\\\\nDespite all of these benefits, law firms are trailing individual lawyers in adoption. It’s a trend that’s likely driven by concerns over ethics, privilege, and lack of trust in outputs.\\\\n\\\\nFirms can avoid these obstacles in a number of ways.\\\\n\\\\nLegal-specific AI tools that are integrated with trusted platforms address these concerns. (43% of firms cite this as the top adoption driver, according to the Legal Industry Report.)\\\\n\\\\nLaw firms can also start with use cases that are lower risk, such as drafting marketing content or summarizing internal memos.\\\\n\\\\nToday’s mature AI systems, however, already bring transformative benefits.\\\\n\\\\nCurious to see how these technologies can position your firm for long-term growth and competitiveness?

This blog explores the rise of AI in legal practice. It covers 80% adoption rates, 24/7 AI legal receptionists, and legal intake automation. Learn how LegalClerk.ai helps firms stay compliant, responsive, and competitive in today’s evolving legal industry.\\\\n\\\\nMaryam Sameer\\\\n\\\\nContent Writer\\\\n\\\\nOctober 8, 2025\\\\n\\\\nFor years, law firms debated whether AI had a real place in legal practice. Some feared it would replace paralegals or complicate compliance. But by 2025, the numbers spoke for themselves: AI adoption in the legal industry jumped from 22% to nearly [80%](https://secretariat-intl.com/insights/ai-adoption-surges-in-the-legal-industry/).\\\\n\\\\nLaw firms of all sizes, from solo practitioners to national firms, are now using AI in legal practice. It handles everyday tasks once seen as too manual or time-consuming. An [AI legal answering service](https://www.legalclerk.ai/blog/ai-legal-answering-service-end-missed-calls-forever) takes client calls and automates legal intake forms.\\\\n\\\\nWhat caused this sudden shift? The short answer: pressure. Clients expect faster responses, and firms face tighter budgets. Meanwhile, attorneys need more hours in the day. AI became the bridge between doing more and burning out less. This shift toward legal AI adoption represents the most significant legal automation trend we've seen.\\\\n\\\\n## How AI in Legal Practice Evolved from Experimentation to Everyday Use\\\\n\\\\nThe legal profession’s relationship with artificial intelligence has changed dramatically in just a year. What began as cautious experimentation has now become everyday practice. Law firms have moved from testing AI tools to strategically implementing them across client intake, scheduling, and communication workflows.\\\\n\\\\nThis momentum grew out of a very real concern in 2024. Many firms simply couldn’t keep pace with the accelerating growth of AI and other disruptive technologies.\\\\n\\\\nAccording to Embroker’s [2025 Legal Industry Risk Index](https://www.embroker.com/insurance-index/legal-risk-index-report/), AI in legal practice was identified as the most pressing issue for law firms last year.\\\\n\\\\nThe data tells a clear story. An 80% adoption rate that marks a major shift from experimentation to execution. AI is no longer viewed as a futuristic concept. It’s now embedded in the way law firms operate, helping lawyers respond faster, manage cases more efficiently, and deliver a better client experience.\\\\n\\\\nBut what does that 80% really look like in action? For many firms, it starts with tools like AI legal answering services, AI legal receptionists, and legal intake automation.\\\\n\\\\n## The Rise of the AI Legal Adoption\\\\n\\\\n### The Digital Team Member That Never Sleeps\\\\n\\\\nThink of an AI legal receptionist as a digital team member. Always available, always polite, and fully trained on your firm’s tone and procedures. Unlike traditional voicemail systems that leave potential clients hanging, AI receptionists deliver immediate, professional responses.\\\\n\\\\nWhen someone calls about a personal injury case at midnight, AI doesn’t say, “We’re closed.” Instead, it greets the caller warmly. It collects key case details, determines urgency, and sends the information straight into your case management system. This seamless integration ensures that no lead slips through the cracks, no matter when they reach out.\\\\n\\\\nExplore: [How do AI legal receptionists and AI legal intake specialists work together to grow your law firm?](https://www.legalclerk.ai/blog/ai-legal-receptionist-vs-ai-legal-intake-specialist-how-they-work-together-to-grow-your-law-firm)\\\\n\\\\n### The Game-Changing Shift in AI Legal Technology\\\\n\\\\nThis evolution toward AI legal client support has become one of the biggest transformations for modern law firms. It allows attorneys to practice law instead of managing phone lines.\\\\n\\\\nThe impact is measurable and significant. Clio's 2024 [Legal Trends Report](https://www.clio.com/resources/legal-trends/2024-report/) reveals that AI adoption among legal professionals skyrocketed from 19% to 79% in just one year. Major firms across the legal industry are reporting similar breakthroughs:\\\\n\\\\n* BigLaw firms lead adoption with [50%](https://www.lexisnexis.co.uk/blog/future-of-law/ai-adoption-amongst-lawyers-passes-tipping-point) currently using AI tools, compared to 37% for smaller firms\\\\n* Mid-sized firms saw [93%](https://www.lawtimesnews.com/news/general/ai-adoption-in-mid-size-law-firms-surges-fivefold-integration-still-lags-clio-report/391893) adoption rates in 2025, up from just 19% the previous year\\\\n* 74% of billable tasks can now be automated according to Clio's analysis of 7 million time entries\\\\n\\\\nThese results demonstrate how AI receptionists and legal intake automation directly boost law firm efficiency and client satisfaction. The data proves that legal automation can elevate, not replace, the human side of service.\\\\n\\\\n### AI Legal Answering Service Beyond Basic Answering\\\\n\\\\nModern AI legal receptionists are far more than automated call handlers. They operate as intelligent intake specialists that can:\\\\n\\\\n* **Qualify leads in real time:** It analyzes caller responses to gauge case viability, urgency, and practice-area fit, ensuring valuable prospects get immediate follow-up.\\\\n* **Integrate with legal technology**: Sync with platforms like Clio, MyCase, and PracticePanther to auto-create records and schedule consultations.\\\\n* **Provide 24/7 professional coverage:** Essential when 39% of law firm calls go unanswered during business hours.\\\\n* **Scale without overhead**: Handling higher call volumes without additional hires or management costs, while maintaining consistent tone and accuracy.\\\\n\\\\n### The ROI Revolution\\\\n\\\\nThe financial upside is undeniable. Many firms calculate 1,700%+ ROI from AI receptionist adoption, with five-person teams saving around $45,000 annually in labor and missed-opportunity costs.\\\\n\\\\n| Cost Comparison | Traditional Receptionist | AI Legal Receptionist |\\\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\\\n| Annual Cost | $30,000–$40,000 + benefits & training | $400–$3,000 / month |\\\\n| Staffing Limits | 8-hour coverage | 24/7 availability |\\\\n| Break-Even Point | — | 2–4 months via improved lead capture |\\\\n\\\\nThese numbers highlight why AI legal technology is a growth engine.

They generate insights that help firms refine operations and marketing. Built-in analytics provide:\\\\n\\\\n* Peak-call-time reports for smarter staffing\\\\n* Inquiry trend data to sharpen ad messaging\\\\n* Lead-source tracking for ROI visibility\\\\n* Conversion-rate dashboards to test new intake scripts\\\\n\\\\n### The Competitive Advantage\\\\n\\\\nAI legal adoption is climbing from 22% to 80% in a single year. Firms that delay legal automation risk falling behind those already delivering faster, always-on client experiences. Early adopters consistently see 35–45% higher intake conversion rates, creating a decisive competitive edge.\\\\n\\\\nUltimately, this transformation isn’t about technology for technology’s sake. It’s about aligning with modern client expectations: immediacy, reliability, and professionalism. AI receptionists meet all three while freeing attorneys to focus on casework and client strategy.\\\\n\\\\nAccording to Reuters’ 2024 [Future of Professionals Report](https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/blog/how-ai-is-transforming-the-legal-profession/#:~:text=Over%20the%20past%20few%20years,can%20have%20on%20their%20practices.), “*Over the past few years, legal professionals have become less wary of artificial intelligence (AI). Indeed, they are increasingly embracing AI as a transformative force. They are becoming more and more optimistic about the positive impact it can have on their practices.”*\\\\n\\\\n## Best Practices for Implementing AI in Legal Practice\\\\n\\\\nLaw firms are now moving forward with AI legal adoption, using AI-powered answering services to build trust, follow the rules, and make daily work easier.\\\\n\\\\n### 1. Create Clear Rules and Policies\\\\n\\\\nEvery firm should start with a written [AI governance policy](https://www.legalclerk.ai/blog/law-firm-compliance-requirements-2025-complete-legal-compliance-checklist). It should explain what AI can and can’t do, when people still need to step in, and how clients will be told about AI use. Having these rules in place early helps firms avoid mistakes and stay within ethical and legal boundaries.\\\\n\\\\n### 2. Keep Data Safe and Confidential\\\\n\\\\nProtecting client information is non-negotiable. The best firms set strong data-security controls that decide what information AI can handle. They also use encryption, strict logins, and trusted vendors to keep private details safe and meet confidentiality standards.\\\\n\\\\n### 3. Implement Rigorous Quality Control\\\\n\\\\nTop firms always double-check what AI produces. Any document, summary, or recommendation created by AI should be reviewed by a person before it reaches a client. Regular checks and feedback help keep results accurate and professional.\\\\n\\\\n### 4. Train and Supervise Your Team\\\\n\\\\nEveryone from paralegals to partners should understand how AI helps and where human judgment still matters. Ongoing training keeps staff aware of both the strengths and limits of these tools. Regular reviews make sure AI in legal practice stays reliable and compliant.\\\\n\\\\n### 5. Be Open with Clients\\\\n\\\\nHonesty builds trust. Firms that clearly explain how they use AI legal technology and get client consent strengthen relationships and reduce risk. Let clients know that AI improves speed and accuracy but doesn’t replace human care. This openness shows professionalism and positions the firm as forward-thinking and responsible.\\\\n\\\\n## Navigating Implementation Risks\\\\n\\\\nAs with any major technology shift, AI in legal practice brings both opportunity and risk. Legal professionals are addressing these challenges thoughtfully as adoption accelerates. Recent 2025 legal industry data highlights three persistent risk areas that demand proactive management:\\\\n\\\\n* Over-reliance and professional liability top concerns at 43%. Lawyers recognize that AI supports, not replaces, attorney judgment. Human oversight remains critical to ethical, responsible practice.\\\\n* Data privacy breaches worry 38% of respondents. With firms managing confidential client information, data security and access control remain top priorities when selecting AI tools.\\\\n* Ethical and legal misuse concerns 37%. Law firms continue to evaluate compliance standards, legal malpractice exposure, and the need for transparent AI governance.\\\\n\\\\nThese concerns show risks associated with increased adoption. AI in legal practice must be implemented within comprehensive risk management frameworks.\\\\n\\\\n## Helpful Tools for AI Legal Receptionists\\\\n\\\\n* [**LegalClerk.ai**](http://legalclerk.ai)**:** AI legal answering servicebuilt specifically for law firms, combining AI innovation with deep compliance expertise.

AI tools have become as essential as legal research databases and case management systems. It reshapes how attorneys, paralegals, and firms operate day to day.\\\\n\\\\nThe legal professionals who successfully navigated this transformation share common traits. They approached AI implementation strategically, prioritized client service, and upheld their ethical and professional obligations.\\\\n\\\\nThe lawyers thriving in this new landscape are the strategic implementers. Those who understand that AI integration in legal practice requires the same planning, oversight, and professionalism that define great legal work.\\\\n\\\\nAs Jordan Furlong, lawyer and legal sector analyst, told [Fortune Magazine](https://fortune.com/2025/07/23/ai-law-legal-lawyers-automation-court/): *“Lawyers are not big R&D people. They’re not hackers and experimenters. They are, ‘Tell me what this thing can do. Tell me it is safe to use it, and I’ll use it… I find it incredibly exciting. Terrifying for sure. Risky, no question. But really exciting.”*\\\\n\\\\nHis words capture the sentiment across the profession, cautious optimism mixed with genuine excitement for what’s ahead.\\\\n\\\\n## What’s Next for AI in Legal Practice\\\\n\\\\nThe rapid rise of AI in legal practice marks more than just a technological upgrade. It signals a lasting change in how legal professionals operate, serve clients, and manage their firms.\\\\n\\\\nThat’s where LegalClerk.ai leads the way.

Legal Aid Organizations Show AI Adoption at 2X the Rate of the Wider Legal Profession\\\\n\\\\nLegal aid organizations are already leveraging AI in their work, recognizing it as a potential lifeline to help them serve more clients.\\\\n\\\\n74% of legal aid organizations report they are already using AI in their work, which is double the generative AI adoption rate of the wider legal profession according to the results of Everlaw’s [*2025 Ediscovery Innovation Report*](https://www.everlaw.com/2025-ediscovery-innovation-report/).\\\\n\\\\nThis aggressive early adoption demonstrates a clear consensus: AI is not a luxury tool reserved for Big Law, but a necessary technology being driven by organizations serving our most vulnerable populations.\\\\n\\\\n### 2. AI Can Help Organizations Serve Clients They Aren’t Currently Able to Reach\\\\n\\\\nMany access to justice organizations [struggle with finding sufficient funding](https://www.everlaw.com/blog/nonprofits-and-pro-bono/nyc-legal-aid-society-expands-affordable-housing-access-for-100-000-families/) and resources, which means they’re often unable to serve all of their clients.\\\\n\\\\nAccording to the survey results, 90% of respondents said using AI to its full potential would enable them to serve more clients**,** and some (17%) estimated that AI may help them serve 50% more clients.\\\\n\\\\nBy automating high-volume, time-consuming tasks like initial intake and document summarization, AI acts as a force multiplier, allowing staff attorneys to dedicate their time to high-value work, such as court appearances and direct client advocacy.\\\\n\\\\n### 3. Strong Belief that AI Will Address Justice Gap\\\\n\\\\nThe primary mission of most legal aid organizations is [addressing the justice gap](https://www.everlaw.com/blog/everlaw-for-good/evening-the-odds/). In a world where lawyers fees continue to rise exponentially, the legal system has never been more unaffordable for large segments of the population.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, this is an area where AI offers hope. 88% of respondents believe AI can help address the access to justice gap to some extent. This widespread optimism underscores the potential for AI to create a more equitable legal system.\\\\n\\\\nThe near-universal optimism underscores AI’s potential to fundamentally democratize legal services. As [Legal Aid of North Carolina’s](https://legalaidnc.org/) Chief Innovation Officer, Scheree Gilchrist, put it, \\\\\\\"We will never be able to ‘lawyer ourselves’ out of this access-to-justice crisis.\\\\\\\" The widespread belief that AI offers a viable path forward signals a turning point in the decades-long struggle for a more equitable legal system.\\\\n\\\\n## **The Path Forward**\\\\n\\\\nThe [findings of this report make it clear](https://www.lawnext.com/2025/09/legal-aid-organizations-embrace-ai-at-twice-the-rate-of-other-lawyers-new-study-reveals.html): AI is no longer a futuristic concept, but a critical, present-day solution for the legal aid community.\\\\n\\\\nAnd, while AI is not a panacea—survey respondents cited concerns over issues like data privacy, confidentiality, and hallucinations—the wider results demonstrate the potential the industry sees in this technology.\\\\n\\\\nThat’s why [EverlawAI Assistant](https://www.everlaw.com/product/everlaw-ai-assistant/) was created with privacy, control, and validation capabilities at the forefront. Everlaw is proud to offer this suite of generative AI features to nonprofit and pro bono practices free of charge.\\\\n\\\\nBy transforming high-volume, time-intensive tasks, [AI acts as a force multiplier](https://www.everlaw.com/product/everlaw-ai-assistant/), allowing legal aid organizations to move beyond the limitations of their current resources and staff. The challenge now is not simply whether to adopt AI, but how to implement it responsibly, ethically, and at scale.\\\\n\\\\nWith proper guidance and responsible use, this technology offers a tangible path to fundamentally reshape the legal landscape, finally turning the ideal of equal access to justice into a widespread reality.\\\\n\\\\n[# Discover how legal aid organizations are using AI to serve more clients.

Is it a Pyrrhic victory?\\\\n\\\\nImage by Adobe Stock/IRStone\\\\n\\\\nDavid L. Brown\\\\n\\\\nOctober 3, 2025 05:00 AM\\\\n\\\\nThe good news: Artificial intelligence may be reducing stress and giving lawyers more breathing room to do their jobs. The bad? Thanks to AI, many may not have jobs to worry about in the not-so-distant future.\\\\n\\\\nA recent survey finds lawyers are experiencing less burnout as AI usage increases in law firms and in-house legal departments. Time-consuming, rote tasks are being taken off their plates, alleviating one of the most stressful aspects of legal work—deadline pressure.\\\\n\\\\n“For decades, we've accepted certain truths as immutable: that legal work inherently involves countless hours of manual document review, that meeting client demands requires sacrificing work-life balance, and that burnout is simply the price of practicing law,” wrote Jasmine Singh, general counsel of Ironclad, the legal tech company that commissioned the survey. “But what if these assumptions are no longer valid?”\\\\n\\\\nWhile the Ironclad survey shows lawyer concerns about being replaced by AI beginning to wane, another report finds that the vast majority of businesses are using artificial intelligence not to augment jobs but to replace them. And law firms continue to ratchet up rates to pay for new technology, a situation clients may tolerate if they see a future with lower legal costs (i.e., fewer associates).\\\\n\\\\nIncreasing Speed\\\\n\\\\nReleased over the summer, Ironclad’s [survey](https://ironcladapp.com/lp/2025-state-of-ai-report/?utm_medium=press-release-organic&utm_source=prnewswire&utm_campaign=fy26-q2-content-state-of-ai-in-legal-2025) was conducted by an independent research firm that asked 800 in-house counsel and law firm lawyers for their feelings about the state of artificial intelligence in the legal industry.\\\\n\\\\nNearly three-quarters of the lawyers using AI said it had sped up their work and increased productivity, and 6 in 10 said it had resulted in better-quality work. More than 90% agreed that AI has improved how they perform their job, and that it has helped them achieve their business goals more easily. AI, the survey report asserted, “has quickly turned from a ‘box to check’ to a business accelerant.”\\\\n\\\\nThe survey found that 69% of lawyers had incorporated AI into their work. Adoption rates are far higher, however, among in-house counsel than those at law firms. More than 80% of in-house lawyers had adopted AI compared to 55% of law firm lawyers.\\\\n\\\\nIn-house lawyers were also far more comfortable using AI than their law firm counterparts and had achieved “more success than law firms in integrating AI into existing workflows,” the report said. The survey shows that 34% of in-house counsel said they had no problem using agentic AI. Seventeen percent of law firm lawyers said the same.\\\\n\\\\nFaster adoption and greater comfort with AI among in-house departments “could be due to greater alignment with broader business objectives and technology ecosystems. It could also be a sign that in-house teams feel pressure to get more done, faster, in order to prove their worth like any other department in a large organization,” the report said.\\\\n\\\\nStress Reliever\\\\n\\\\nIronclad also asked lawyers how they are currently feeling about their jobs. Overall, 41% of the lawyers surveyed reported burnout symptoms, with law firm attorneys feeling somewhat more frazzled (44%) than in-house lawyers (37%). The factors causing the highest levels of job dissatisfaction, the lawyers said, were meeting stressful deadlines, feelings of burnout and having too many tasks to complete in one day.\\\\n\\\\nThose results, the report noted, are in line with surveys by ALM/Law.com, Bloomberg Law and others that also found between 40% and 45% of lawyers were facing burnout because of “high stress levels, excessive working hours and poor work-life balance, particularly in large firms.”\\\\n\\\\nThe Ironclad survey said that artificial intelligence is giving lawyers some hope for relief. Seventy-six percent of lawyers responding to the survey strongly or somewhat agreed that AI tools helped decrease feelings of burnout at work.\\\\n\\\\nMany of the AI tools that lawyers use are “aligned to help address the leading causes of job dissatisfaction,” the report said. AI helped improve work speed for 72% of lawyers, which, in turn, has relieved time pressures. Roughly half of lawyers said they value AI for taking on mundane or rote tasks. And 57% said AI tools allowed them to be more strategic in their work, “suggesting that AI enables the higher-order thinking and planning that increases job satisfaction,” the report said.\\\\n\\\\nCareer Optimism\\\\n\\\\nIn general, in-house and law firm lawyers see AI as a positive for their career prospects, the Ironclad survey said. Among in-house lawyers, in particular, AI is seen as boosting their ability to communicate with business stakeholders, clients and outside counsel. More than a quarter of the lawyers surveyed said using AI tools has improved the quality of their business relationships, and just over 20% said AI skills have improved their professional image within their organizations.\\\\n\\\\n“Beyond the obvious applications—contract review, research and risk identification —we're witnessing something more profound: a fundamental shift in what it means to practice law,” Ironclad’s Singh wrote. “The technology isn't just automating tasks; it's creating space for lawyers to engage with the intellectual and strategic aspects of their work that drew them to the profession in the first place.”\\\\n\\\\nThe positive feelings about AI tools are also fueling more optimism among lawyers about whether AI will create career opportunities. Nearly half of the lawyers surveyed—46%—said they believed AI will boost their careers. The feelings were rosier among in-house lawyers (55%) than those in firms (37%).\\\\n\\\\nNonetheless, losing their jobs remains a significant concern—especially among the law firm lawyers surveyed. Overall, 36% of all lawyers and 40% of those in law firms said they believe AI is snuffing out legal career opportunities.\\\\n\\\\nAutomation vs. Augmentation\\\\n\\\\nThey have some reason for concern, at least according to Anthropic, maker of Claude AI. In a [report](https://www.anthropic.com/research/anthropic-economic-index-september-2025-report) on the economic impact of AI released in September, Anthropic found that instead of augmenting human labor, artificial intelligence was replacing it.\\\\n\\\\nExamining usage of the Claude AI platform, researchers found that 77% of the businesses using the software were automating tasks, with many engaging in “full task delegation.” In tech parlance, that means fully replacing human activity with AI.\\\\n\\\\nWhile many business and tech leaders have touted artificial intelligence as a collaboration tool that will improve workers’ ability to do their jobs, just 12% of Claude usage is designed to augment tasks. “When businesses embed Claude into their applications, they largely delegate individual tasks rather than collaborate iteratively with models,” Anthropic found.\\\\n\\\\nFuturism, a website covering technology and scientific developments, [said](https://futurism.com/anthropic-report-dire-news-job-market) Anthropic’s findings “are a stark reflection of businesses’ intentions” when deploying AI. “While many AI leaders have warned that AI will severely disrupt the job market, it’s often balanced by the sunny promise that it will work alongside human workers to make their jobs easier,” the website said. “But if over three-quarters of the companies in the report are using AI for outright automation, it portends much darker implications.”\\\\n\\\\nWhile the report does not extend to other AI models like ChatGPT, Futurism noted that as “one of the leaders in the industry” Anthropic’s data “provides a useful barometer.”\\\\n\\\\nCosts Soar\\\\n\\\\nMeanwhile, legal industry analysts are openly discussing the day when law firms will be able to cut costs—and lawyers—and replace them with AI.\\\\n\\\\nAt the moment, however, firms are seeing major increases in operating costs as they incorporate new technology. Data released by Wells Fargo’s Legal Specialty Group in August showed that during the first half of 2025, law firm expenses—excluding salaries—soared by 8.6%. \\\\\\\"In the meantime, you have both the associates and the AI, and there aren't any expense savings right now, it's just expenses,\\\\\\\" a Wells Fargo analyst [said](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/law-firm-rates-revenues-soar-costs-pile-up-ai-era-2025-08-28/) in an interview with Reuters.\\\\n\\\\nHow are firms paying for the technology upgrades? By passing the costs onto clients. While costs were up, revenues spiked as well, Wells Fargo found. During the first half of the year, rates rose by 9.2%, Wells Fargo said. That helped drive an 11.3% increase in revenue and a nearly 14% hike in profits per equity partner at the 130 firms Wells Fargo surveyed.\\\\n\\\\nWhile the future of legal jobs may be uncertain, that hasn’t put a damper on people looking to enter the profession. As we recently [wrote](https://www.bestlawfirms.com/articles/everyone-wants-law-school-degree-now-economy-politics-data/6901), the number of people applying to law school is at its highest level in 14 years.\\\\n\\\\nAnd even with the costs associated with AI, firms have been hiring, according to data from the American Bar Association and the National Association for Law Placement (NALP). More than 80% of recent law school graduates have found a job, the ABA said. And according to NALP, nearly 60% took jobs in private practice—the highest level in more than 30 years.\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\n[David L.

out of options.\\\\n\\\\nBehind on payments for her mobile home in Long Beach, California, and facing an eviction notice, she had no money for a lawyer. So she accepted a court-appointed attorney and lost.\\\\n\\\\nBut White wanted to appeal. So, she decided to consult ChatGPT. Having previously used AI to generate videos for her small music production business, she thought it might be able to help in the legal arena, too.\\\\n\\\\n“It was like having God up there responding to my questions,” White said after using the chatbot and an AI-powered search engine called Perplexity to help represent herself in court.\\\\n\\\\n![Image 2: Lynn White outside her RV home pro se and AI A.I. artificial Intelligence litigant](https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251001-Lynn-White-ac-750p-730ca7.jpg)\\\\n\\\\nLynn White outside her RV home.Alyson Aliano for NBC News\\\\n\\\\nWhite regularly provided ChatGPT with documents and detailed information about her case. The chatbot helped White identify potential errors in a judge’s procedural decisions, chart out possible courses of action, research applicable laws and draft responses to the court.\\\\n\\\\nSeveral months of litigation later, White managed to overturn her eviction notice and avoid roughly $55,000 in penalties and more than $18,000 in overdue rent.\\\\n\\\\n### Recommended\\\\n\\\\n[![Image 3](https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251003-ai-circular-bubble-jg-4fbd21.jpg)](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/openai-nvidia-amd-deals-risks-rcna234806)[Artificial intelligence](https://www.nbcnews.com/artificial-intelligence)[](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/openai-nvidia-amd-deals-risks-rcna234806)\\\\n\\\\n### [Artificial intelligence](https://www.nbcnews.com/artificial-intelligence)[The AI boom's reliance on circular deals is raising fears of a bubble](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/openai-nvidia-amd-deals-risks-rcna234806)\\\\n\\\\n[![Image 4](https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-05/240513-openAi-mn-1120-4728ba.jpg)](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/amd-signs-ai-chip-supply-deal-openai-rcna235860)[Artificial intelligence](https://www.nbcnews.com/artificial-intelligence)[](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/amd-signs-ai-chip-supply-deal-openai-rcna235860)\\\\n\\\\n### [Artificial intelligence](https://www.nbcnews.com/artificial-intelligence)[AMD signs AI chip-supply deal with OpenAI](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/amd-signs-ai-chip-supply-deal-openai-rcna235860)\\\\n\\\\n“I can’t overemphasize the usefulness of AI in my case,” White said. “I never, ever, ever, ever could have won this appeal without AI.”\\\\n\\\\nWhite originally used the free version of ChatGPT before upgrading to its premium service for $20 a month. White used Perplexity Pro, which also costs $20 a month.\\\\n\\\\nWith a slew of generative AI tools available to anyone with an internet connection, a rising number of litigants are using AI to assist in their legal cases. Many are eschewing lawyers altogether, representing themselves in court with AI as their primary guide.\\\\n\\\\nTo understand the role of AI in self-represented, or pro se, litigation, NBC News spoke with over 15 pro se litigants, legal professionals, nonprofit leaders, AI startups and legal research companies.\\\\n\\\\nIn interviews, lawyers and litigants described AI as producing mixed results in court. Some say AI tools are helping them navigate mazes of court procedure and simplify legal jargon. Others have faced steep penalties for submitting court filings with inaccurate or nonexistent information. Regardless of the consequences, legal practitioners and experts say generative AI tools appear to be encouraging certain people to seek legal guidance from algorithms instead of human lawyers.\\\\n\\\\n“I’ve seen more and more pro se litigants in the last year than I have in probably my entire career,” said Meagan Holmes, a paralegal at Phoenix-based law firm Thorpe Shwer, talking about the use of AI chatbots in law.\\\\n\\\\nSome leading AI companies discourage customers from using their services for legal purposes, while others have made little to no mention of the possibility. Google's terms of service state: “Don’t rely on the Services for medical, legal, financial, or other professional advice. Any content regarding those topics is provided for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for advice from a qualified professional.” The acceptable use policy for xAI warns users not to use its models to operate “in a regulated industry or region without complying with those regulations.”\\\\n\\\\nYet when asked legal questions, most chatbots will respond and provide legal advice without any warnings beyond ever-present, fine-print disclaimers noting that generative AI answers may not be accurate.\\\\n\\\\nIn a statement, Perplexity spokesperson Jesse Dwyer told NBC News: “We don’t claim to be 100% accurate, but we do claim to be the only company who works on it relentlessly.”\\\\n\\\\n“The consumer use of AI in some of the most challenging aspects of the legal ecosystem is proof of how necessary that reliability and accuracy is,” Dwyer wrote.\\\\n\\\\nOpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind and xAI did not respond to requests for comment.\\\\n\\\\n![Image 5: Staci Dennett ai a.i. artificial intelligence](https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251001-staci-dennett-ai-ac-609p-a384b6.jpg)\\\\n\\\\nStaci Dennett used ChatGPT to negotiate a settlement after she was served a court summons over an unpaid debt.Courtesy Staci Dennett\\\\n\\\\nStaci Dennett is among the many litigants now representing herself using AI. Dennett owns a home fitness business in New Mexico and describes herself as an early adopter of AI. So when she was served with a court summons about an unpaid debt, she turned to ChatGPT for advice on how to respond.\\\\n\\\\n“I’m not normally fighting lawsuits on ChatGPT, but I do use it a lot in my business and in my life,” she said.\\\\n\\\\nThe bot provided templates and drafted arguments for her responses, with Dennett regularly asking it to find potential errors in her logic. “I would tell ChatGPT to pretend it was a Harvard Law professor and to rip my arguments apart,” she said. “Rip it apart until I got an A-plus on the assignment.”\\\\n\\\\nWhite ultimately negotiated a settlement and saved over $2,000 compared to her original debt, which she said was a partial victory she attributes largely to AI.\\\\n\\\\nShe said the opposing lawyers complimented her on her knowledge of the law and court proceedings as the case was wrapping up, writing to her in an email: “If the law is something you’re interested in as a profession, you could certainly do the job.”\\\\n\\\\n![Image 6: lynn white ai a.i. artificial intelligence ](https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251001-combo-Lynn-White-ac-743p-dfb91d.jpg)\\\\n\\\\nLynn White organizes her legal documents in her home; White using her computer.Alyson Aliano for NBC News\\\\n\\\\nThe price of AI legal advice\\\\n============================\\\\n\\\\nEven as some litigants have found success in small-claims disputes, legal professionals who spoke to NBC News say AI-drafted court documents are often littered with inaccuracies and faulty reasoning.\\\\n\\\\nHolmes said litigants “will use a case that ChatGPT gave them, and when I go to look it up, it does not exist. Most of the time, we get them dismissed for failure to state an actual claim, because a lot of times it’s just kind of, not to be rude, but nonsense.” AI models often generate information that is false or misleading but presented as fact, a phenomenon known as “hallucination.” Chatbots are trained on vast datasets to predict the most likely response to a query but sometimes encounter gaps in their knowledge. In these cases, the model may attempt to fill in the missing pieces with its best approximation, which can result in inaccurate or fabricated details.\\\\n\\\\nFor litigants, AI hallucinations can lead to pricey penalties. Jack Owoc, a colorful Florida-based energy drink mogul who [lost a false advertising case to the tune of $311 million](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/us-court-affirms-monster-energys-311-mln-court-win-against-former-rival-bang-2025-04-15/) and is now representing himself, was recently sanctioned for [filing a court motion with 11 AI-hallucinated citations](https://websitedc.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/Monster_v._Owoc.pdf) referencing court cases that do not exist.\\\\n\\\\n![Image 7: Jack Owoc ai a.i. artificial intelligence](https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251001-jack-owoc-ai-ac-815p-b7b714.jpg)\\\\n\\\\nJack Owoc, founder of Bang Energy, admitted using AI to draft court documents.Courtesy Jack Owoc\\\\n\\\\nOwoc admitted he had used generative AI to draft the document due to his limited finances. He was ordered to complete 10 hours of community service and is now required to disclose whether he uses AI in all future filings in the case.\\\\n\\\\n“Just like a law firm would have to check the work of a junior associate, so do you have to check the work generated by AI,” Owoc said via email.\\\\n\\\\nHolmes and other legal professionals say there are common telltale signs of careless AI use, such as citations to nonexistent case law, filler language that was left in, and ChatGPT-style emoji or formatting that looks nothing like a typical legal document.\\\\n\\\\nDamien Charlotin, a legal researcher and data scientist, has organized a [public database](https://www.damiencharlotin.com/hallucinations/) tracking legal decisions in cases where litigants were caught using AI in court. He’s documented 282 such cases in the U.S. and more than 130 from other countries dating back to 2023.\\\\n\\\\n“It really started to accelerate around the spring of 2025,” Charlotin said.\\\\n\\\\nAnd the database is far from exhaustive. It only tracks cases where the established or alleged use of AI was directly addressed by the court, and Charlotin said most of its entries are referred to him by lawyers or other researchers. He noted that there are generally three types of AI hallucinations:\\\\n\\\\n“You got the fabricated case law, and that’s quite easy to spot, because the case does not exist. Then you got the false quotations from existing case law. That’s also rather easy to spot because you do control-F,” Charlotin said. “And then there is misrepresented case law. That’s much harder, because you’re citing something that exists but you’re totally misrepresenting it.”\\\\n\\\\nEarl Takefman has experienced AI’s hallucinatory tendencies firsthand. He is currently representing himself in several cases in Florida regarding a pickleball business deal gone awry and started using AI to help him in court last year.\\\\n\\\\n“It never for a second even crossed my mind that ChatGPT would totally make up cases, and unfortunately, I found out the hard way,” Takefman told NBC News.\\\\n\\\\nTakefman realized his mistake when the opposing counsel pointed out a hallucinated case in one of Takefman’s filings. “I went back to ChatGPT and told it that it really f----d me over,” he said. “It apologized.”\\\\n\\\\nA judge admonished Takefman for citing the same nonexistent case — an imaginary one from 1995 called Hernandez v. Gilbert — in two separate filings, among other missteps, according to court documents.\\\\n\\\\nEmbarrassed about the oversight, Takefman resolved to be more careful. “So I said, ‘OK, I know how to get around it. I’m going to ask ChatGPT to give me actual quotations from the court case I want to reference. Surely they would never make up an actual quotation.’ And it turns out they were making that up too!”\\\\n\\\\n“I certainly did not intend to mislead the court,” Takefman said. “They take it very, very seriously and don’t let you off the hook because you’re a pro se litigant.”\\\\n\\\\nIn late August, the court forced Takefman to explain why he should not receive sanctions given his mistakes. The court accepted Takefman’s apology and did not apply sanctions.\\\\n\\\\nThe experience has not turned off Takefman from using AI in his court dealings.\\\\n\\\\n“Now, I check between different applications, so I’ll take what Grok gives me and give it to ChatGPT and see if it agrees — that all the cases are real, that there aren’t any hallucinations, and that the cases actually mean what the AI thinks they mean,” Takefman said.\\\\n\\\\n“Then, I put all of the cases into Google to do one last check to make sure that the cases are real. That way, I can actually say to a judge that I checked the case and it exists,” Takefman said.\\\\n\\\\nSo far, the majority of AI hallucinations in Charlotin’s database come from pro se litigants, but many have also come from lawyers themselves.\\\\n\\\\nEarlier this month, a California court ordered an attorney to [pay a $10,000 fine](https://www4.courts.ca.gov/opinions/documents/B331918.PDF) for filing a state court appeal in which 21 of the 23 quotes from cited cases were hallucinated by ChatGPT. It appears to be the largest-ever fine issued over AI fabrications, according to [CalMatters](https://calmatters.org/economy/technology/2025/09/chatgpt-lawyer-fine-ai-regulation/).\\\\n\\\\n“I can understand more easily how someone without a lawyer, and maybe who feels like they don’t have the money to access an attorney, would be tempted to rely on one of these tools,” said Robert Freund, an attorney who regularly contributes to Charlotin’s database. “What I can’t understand is an attorney betraying the most fundamental parts of our responsibilities to our clients … and making these arguments that are based on total fabrication.”\\\\n\\\\nFreund, who runs a law firm in Los Angeles, said the influx of AI hallucinations wastes both the court’s and the opposing party’s time by forcing them to use up resources identifying factual inaccuracies. Even after a judge admonishes someone caught filing [AI slop](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna225969), sometimes the same plaintiff continues to flood the court with AI-generated filings “filled with junk.”\\\\n\\\\nMatthew Garces, a registered nurse in New Mexico who’s a strong proponent of using AI to represent himself in legal matters, is currently involved in 28 federal civil suits, including 10 active appeals and several petitions to the Supreme Court. These cases cover a range of topics, including medical malpractice, housing disputes between Garces and his landlord, and alleged improper judicial conduct toward Garces.\\\\n\\\\nAfter noting that Garces submitted documents referencing numerous nonexistent cases, a panel of judges from the 5th U.S. Court of Appeals recently criticized [Garces’ prolific filing](https://websitedc.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/Garces_v._Hernandez_USA_19_August_2025.pdf) of new cases, writing that he is “WARNED FOR A SECOND TIME” to avoid any “future frivolous, repetitive, or otherwise abusive filings” or risk increasingly severe penalties.\\\\n\\\\nA magistrate judge in another of Garces’ cases [also recommended](https://app.midpage.ai/document/garces-v-rossbach-1000441688650?refG=true) that he be banned from filing any lawsuits without the express authorization of a more senior judge, and that Garces be classified as “a vexatious litigant.”\\\\n\\\\nStill, Garces told NBC News that “AI provides access to the courthouse doors that money often keeps closed. Managing nearly 30 federal suits on my own would be nearly impossible without AI tools to organize, research and prepare filings.”\\\\n\\\\n![Image 8: Zoe Dolan lawyer ai a.i. artificial intelligence](https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251001-zoe-dolan-ai-lawyer-ac-755p-696d6b.jpg)\\\\n\\\\nZoe Dolan has helped self-represented litigants learn how to use AI.Alyson Aliano for NBC News\\\\n\\\\nSome lawyers remain optimistic\\\\n==============================\\\\n\\\\nAs the use of AI in court grows, some pro bono legal clinics are now trying to teach their self-representing clients to use AI in ways that help rather than harm them — without offering direct legal advice.\\\\n\\\\n“This is the most exciting time to be a lawyer,” said Zoe Dolan, a supervising attorney at Public Counsel, a nonprofit public interest law firm and legal advocacy center in Los Angeles. “The amount of impact that any one advocate can now have is only sort of limited by our imagination and organizational structures.”\\\\n\\\\nLast year, Dolan [helped create a class](https://synapticjustice.substack.com/p/ai-program-for-self-represented-litigants) for self-represented litigants in Los Angeles County to learn how to leverage AI in their cases. The class taught participants how to use various prompts to create documents, how to fact-check the AI systems’ outputs and how to use chatbots to verify other chatbots’ work.\\\\n\\\\nSeveral of the litigants who took the class, including White, have gone on to win their cases while using AI.\\\\n\\\\nNumerous legal professionals railing against the sloppy use of AI in court also say that they’re not opposed to the use of AI among lawyers more generally. In fact, many say they feel optimistic about AI adoption by legal professionals who have the expertise to analyze and verify its outputs.\\\\n\\\\nAndrew Montez, an attorney in Southern California, said that despite his firm “seeing pro se litigants constantly using AI” over the past six months, he himself has found AI tools useful as a starting point for research or brainstorming. He said he never inputs real client names or confidential information, and he checks every citation manually.\\\\n\\\\nWhile AI cannot substitute for his own legal research and analysis, Montez said, these systems enable lawyers to write better-researched briefs more quickly.\\\\n\\\\n“Going forward in the legal profession, all attorneys will have to use AI in some way or another. Otherwise they will be outgunned,” Montez said. “AI is the great equalizer. Internet research, to a certain extent, made law libraries obsolete. I think AI is really the next frontier.”\\\\n\\\\nAs for pro se litigants without legal expertise, Montez said he believes most cases are too complex for AI alone to understand sufficient context and provide good enough analysis to help someone succeed in court. But he noted that he could envision a future in which more people will use AI to successfully represent themselves, especially in small claims courts.\\\\n\\\\nWhite, who avoided eviction this year with the help of ChatGPT and Perplexity.ai, said she views AI as a way to level the playing field. When asked what advice she would give to other pro se litigants, she thought it was fitting to craft a reply with ChatGPT.\\\\n\\\\n![Image 9: lynn white ai a.i. artificial intelligence](https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251001-Lynn-White-ac-746p-d6da3b.jpg)\\\\n\\\\nLynn White stands at her desk in her home.Alyson Aliano for NBC News\\\\n\\\\n“AI gave me research support, drafting help and organizational skills that I could not access.

AI adoption has surged dramatically, with some studies showing law firms’ usage jumping from 22% to nearly 80% within a year[2]. This rapid uptake signals a shift from cautious experimentation to widespread, strategic implementation of AI tools aimed at both legal and administrative tasks.\\n\\n### Key Efficiency Gains in Law Firms\\n\\nAI has become integral in enhancing law firm productivity across multiple fronts. Approximately 61% of firms using AI report improved efficiency, with 21% noting significant improvements[1]. Legal-specific AI tools are now commonly used for legal research and writing, contract review and summarization, data extraction, and drafting document templates, thereby reducing billable but non-value-adding hours[1]. AI streamlines workflows such as client intake and scheduling through 24/7 AI-powered receptionists and automated legal intake platforms, helping firms capture and qualify leads more effectively while reducing administrative burdens[2].\\n\\nMoreover, AI enables legal teams to focus on higher-value, strategic work by automating routine tasks like email drafting and file review. Financially, AI also contributes to improving law firm wellness by facilitating better payment collections and informed decision-making through enhanced data analysis[1]. For firms slow to adopt AI, there is a risk of falling behind as competitors leverage these tools for both legal and business operations[1].\\n\\n### Expanding Access to Justice Through AI\\n\\nAI adoption is particularly robust among legal aid organizations, with 74% already using AI tools—double the rate of the wider legal profession[3]. These organizations face enormous caseloads and resource limitations; AI tools help by automating high-volume tasks such as client intake and document summarization, effectively multiplying their capacity to serve clients. An overwhelming 88% of legal aid professionals see AI as a key factor in addressing the persistent justice gap, enabling them to reach more low-income individuals who traditionally receive inadequate legal help[3]. This trend underscores AI's critical role not only in commercial legal practice but also in democratizing legal access.\\n\\n### Impact on Lawyer Burnout and Career Outlook\\n\\nAI is also easing lawyer burnout by reducing workload and deadline pressures. Recent surveys demonstrate that nearly three-quarters of lawyers using AI report increased work speed and productivity, while more than 90% agree AI improves their job performance and helps achieve business goals[4]. AI’s automation of routine, time-consuming tasks enables lawyers to engage more deeply in strategic and intellectually rewarding work, enhancing job satisfaction[4].\\n\\nNonetheless, the acceleration of AI adoption raises concerns about job security—36% of lawyers overall, and 40% of law firm lawyers, perceive AI as a threat to legal career opportunities[4]. While AI primarily serves as a tool for augmentation today, some studies indicate a potential pivot toward task automation and replacement, which firms currently fund through increased legal rates[4].\\n\\n### Cautionary Notes and Responsible Use\\n\\nDespite the benefits, AI use in the legal sector demands careful management to mitigate risks including ethical concerns, data privacy, and AI “hallucinations”—instances where AI fabricates information. Reports highlight increasing incidences of inaccurate AI-generated legal filings especially among pro se litigants, underscoring the necessity for human oversight and rigorous quality control[5]. Law firms are advised to implement clear AI governance policies, train personnel adequately, and maintain transparency with clients about AI usage to ensure responsible adoption[2].\\n\\n### Looking Ahead\\n\\nAI is no longer an experimental accessory but a central element in modern legal practice. Forward-thinking law firms and legal aid organizations that embrace AI strategically are gaining measurable advantages in operational efficiency, client service quality, and lawyer well-being. However, sustained success depends on balancing technological innovation with professional standards and ethical obligations, ensuring AI acts as a force multiplier rather than a source of risk.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Sources\\n\\n[1] 3 Ways Lawyers Are Finding New Efficiencies With AI — Above the Law  \\n[2] The Great Legal AI Shift: Why 2025 Became the Year Law Firms Finally Embraced Automation — LegalClerk.ai  \\n[3] 88% of Legal Aid Professionals See AI as Key for Access to Justice — Everlaw  \\n[4] Is AI Killing Lawyer Burnout—And Also Their Jobs? — Best Law Firms  \\n[5] People are using ChatGPT as a lawyer in court.
